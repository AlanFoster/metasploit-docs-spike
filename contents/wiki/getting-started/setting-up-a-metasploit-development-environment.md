title: Setting Up a Metasploit Development Environment
---

This is a guide for setting up a developer environment to contribute modules, documentation, and fixes to the Metasploit Framework. If you just want to use Metasploit for legal, authorized hacking, we recommend instead you:

- Install the open-source Omnibus installer, or
- Use the pre-installed Metasploit on Kali Linux or Parrot Linux.

If you want to contribute to Metasploit, start by reading our CONTRIBUTING.md, then follow the rest of this guide.
