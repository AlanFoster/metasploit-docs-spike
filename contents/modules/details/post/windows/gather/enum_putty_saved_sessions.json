  "description": "This module will identify whether Pageant (PuTTY Agent) is running and obtain saved session\n                        information from the registry. PuTTY is very configurable; some users may have configured\n                        saved sessions which could include a username, private key file to use when authenticating,\n                        host name etc.  If a private key is configured, an attempt will be made to download and store\n                        it in loot. It will also record the SSH host keys which have been stored. These will be connections that\n                        the user has previously after accepting the host SSH fingerprint and therefore are of particular\n                        interest if they are within scope of a penetration test.",
