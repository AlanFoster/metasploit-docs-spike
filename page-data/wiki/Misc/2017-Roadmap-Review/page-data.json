How did we do? For achievements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Metasploit data model backend: we did a lot of design work on this, and got a couple of initial Proof-of-Concept project built. You can see a video of it here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvuy6A-ie1g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvuy6A-ie1g</a>. In the mean time, we started merging parts of the main development branch </li>\n<li>The first pass of external session handling landed with the metasploit-proxy project. </li>\n<li>Independent modules that run in isolation <em>did</em> land, along with a hand full of new modules demonstrating the advantages of the design, including multi-language support.</li>\n<li>The ruby_smb project made a lot of progress, with support incorporated into several existing modules. Full client-side support is also available for testing now.</li>\n<li>Native iOS and macOS support landed, along with many new IoT and router exploits.</li>\n<li>Meterpreter shrank almost 4x thanks to the new cryptTLV packet obfuscation support, and the removal of OpenSSL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things we didn't quite finish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metasploit's RESTful interface was not complete in 2017, so we will continue it into 2018.</li>\n<li>Session handling as a separate process was implemented with the <a href=\"https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-aggregator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-aggregator</a> project, but more work needs to be done to improve scalability and usability.</li>\n<li>Asynchronous session support remains on the drawing board.</li>\n<li>SOCKS5 support did not land, but Metasploit did gain a lot more support for running modules externally as separate processes, and gained initial support for running modules in Python.</li>\n<li>Modernized payload generation with new tools continues to be researched.</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"32805ab6-38f0-5f85-b093-f49f0a7ff262"}}}
