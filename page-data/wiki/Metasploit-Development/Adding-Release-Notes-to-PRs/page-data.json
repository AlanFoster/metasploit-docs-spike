By looking at our release notes, our users should be able to easily understand what's new, what's fixed, and what's changed in the release. Therefore, <strong>all PRs, except for minor fixes and tweaks, must have release notes.</strong></p>\n<p>To add a release note to a pull request, you'll need to add it as a comment, like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dgzQxyD.png\" alt=\"Release Notes Example\"></p>\n<p>You'll need to tag the comment for inclusion in the release notes by using the <code class=\"language-text\"># Release Notes</code> heading. After you apply the release notes heading, you can enter the release notes text you want to use. </p>\n<p>That's it! After you add the release notes text, we'll be able to extract them from the pull requests when we run our release notes script and compile them into a single document. </p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-release-notes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-release-notes\" aria-label=\"writing release notes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing Release Notes</h2>\n<p>Okay, so now that you know how to add a release note, you're wondering what you're supposed to write. </p>\n<p>Basically, a release note summarizes the pull request and describes the value of the fix/feature to the user. Each release note has a title, a PR number, and a brief description. </p>\n<p>Here's an example of what a release note looks likes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Beholder plugin automatically captures keystrokes, screenshots, and webcam snapshots from your active sessions.

To resolve host names on the target, you can run the 'resolve' command followed by the host name. For example, in the Meterpreter prompt, you can type something like 'resolve rapid7.com' to view the host resolutions for Rapid7.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"release-notes-for-fixes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#release-notes-for-fixes\" aria-label=\"release notes for fixes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Release Notes for Fixes</h3>\n<p>A fix is for an issue that caused a particular feature or functionality to not work the way it's expected to work.
