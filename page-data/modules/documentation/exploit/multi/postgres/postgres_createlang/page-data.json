When enabled, command execution is possible on the host.\n        To execute system commands, loading the \"untrusted\" version of the language is necessary.\n        This requires a superuser. This is usually postgres. The execution should be platform-agnostic,\n        and has been tested on OS X, Windows, and Linux.\n\n        This module attempts to load Perl or Python to execute system commands. As this dynamically loads\n        a scripting language to execute commands, it is not necessary to drop a file on the filesystem.\n\n        Only Postgres 8 and up are supported.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/postgres/postgres_createlang","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/postgres/postgres_createlang"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8893e716-3a22-5d68-932e-76e558f923b1"}}}
