The victim's Firefox browser\n        will pop a dialog asking if they trust the addon.\n\n        Once the user clicks \"install\", the addon is installed and\n        executes the payload with full user permissions. As of Firefox\n        4, this will work without a restart as the addon is marked to\n        be \"bootstrapped\". As the addon will execute the payload after\n        each Firefox restart, an option can be given to automatically\n        uninstall the addon once the payload has been executed.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_xpi_bootstrapped_addon","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_xpi_bootstrapped_addon"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4e853acb-85d5-5638-92e1-04aa3da5b3cf"}}}
