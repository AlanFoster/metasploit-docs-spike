By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype,\n        the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available.\n\n        With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be\n        overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here,\n        another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to \"peek\"\n        into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL,\n        the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager\n        API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"00a9cdc8-06bb-598f-b81f-17e7e7881127"}}}
