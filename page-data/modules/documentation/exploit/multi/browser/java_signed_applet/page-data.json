The resulting\n        signed applet is presented to the victim via a web page with\n        an applet tag.  The victim's JVM will pop a dialog asking if\n        they trust the signed applet.\n\n        On older versions the dialog will display the value of CERTCN\n        in the \"Publisher\" line.  Newer JVMs display \"UNKNOWN\" when the\n        signature is not trusted (i.e., it's not signed by a trusted\n        CA).  The SigningCert option allows you to provide a trusted\n        code signing cert, the values in which will override CERTCN.\n        If SigningCert is not given, a randomly generated self-signed\n        cert will be used.\n\n        Either way, once the user clicks \"run\", the applet executes\n        with full user permissions.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/browser/java_signed_applet","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/browser/java_signed_applet"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"7644dd2b-303c-5672-9741-95609ed16191"}}}
