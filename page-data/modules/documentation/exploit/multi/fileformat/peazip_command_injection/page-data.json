All\n        versions prior to 2.6.2 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was conducted with\n        version 2.6.1 on Windows.\n\n        In order for the command to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to\n        open a specially crafted zip file with PeaZip, and access the specially file via\n        double-clicking it. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands\n        as the victim user.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/fileformat/peazip_command_injection","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/fileformat/peazip_command_injection","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/fileformat/peazip_command_injection"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91c9aab2-3840-54ce-b081-9622c994de2e"}}}
