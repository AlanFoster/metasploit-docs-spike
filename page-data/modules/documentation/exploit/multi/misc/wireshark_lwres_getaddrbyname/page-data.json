This bug found and reported by babi.\n\n        This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several\n        other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n        The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents\n        exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows\n        exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get\n        fragmented, which may cause additional complications.\n\n        NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered.\n        If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to\n        exploit this issue.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"fb84b637-1875-59f6-9cfa-8f367638b720"}}}
