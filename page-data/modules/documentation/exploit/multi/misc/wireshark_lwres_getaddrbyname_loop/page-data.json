This bug found and reported by babi.\n\n        This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several\n        other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n        The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents\n        exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows\n        exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get\n        fragmented, which may cause additional complications.\n\n        NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered.\n        If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to\n        exploit this issue.\n\n        This version loops, sending the packet every X seconds until the job is killed.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname_loop","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname_loop"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8c5e7976-7ddb-5410-98c0-097d223dbf78"}}}
