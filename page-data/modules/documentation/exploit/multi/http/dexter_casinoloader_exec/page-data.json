This is done by accessing the\n        PHP page used by bots to report in (gateway.php) which does not sanitize input.\n        Input is encrypted and encoded, but the key is supplied by the bot connecting.\n        The 'page' parameter is used in this case.  The command and control panel designates\n        a location to upload files, and can be used as a reliable location to write a\n        PHP shell.  Authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/dexter_casinoloader_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/dexter_casinoloader_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cb60c086-1e6c-5ed8-9258-1b7c16419c9a"}}}
