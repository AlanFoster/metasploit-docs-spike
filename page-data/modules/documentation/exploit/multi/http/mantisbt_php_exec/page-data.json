The import page is not checking the correct user level\n        of the user, so it's possible to exploit this issue with any user including the anonymous one if enabled.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f326ac2a-23f3-5785-95d8-946acb56eb35"}}}
