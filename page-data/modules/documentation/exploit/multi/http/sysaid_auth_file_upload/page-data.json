While an attacker needs an administrator\n        account in order to leverage this vulnerability, there is a related Metasploit\n        auxiliary module which can create this account under some circumstances.\n        This module has been tested in SysAid v14.4 in both Linux and Windows.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/sysaid_auth_file_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/sysaid_auth_file_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/sysaid_auth_file_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ec478d7-45a1-5d91-8acc-6198c9f2b5aa"}}}
