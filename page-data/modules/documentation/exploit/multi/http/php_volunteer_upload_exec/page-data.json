This application has an upload feature that allows an\n        authenticated user to upload anything to the 'uploads' directory, which is actually\n        reachable by anyone without a credential.  An attacker can easily abuse this upload\n        functionality first by logging in with the default credential (admin:volunteer),\n        upload a malicious payload, and then execute it by sending another GET request.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/php_volunteer_upload_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/php_volunteer_upload_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"bf208981-2f74-52e0-b6ed-9e0530d46bf2"}}}
