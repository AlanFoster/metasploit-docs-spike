The showenv url can be used to disclose information about a server. A second\n      vulnerability that allows arbitrary reading and writing to the host filesystem can then be\n      used to write a shell from a remote url to a known local path disclosed from the previous\n      vulnerability.\n\n      The local path being accessible from an URL allows an attacker to perform the remote code\n      execution using, for example, a .jsp shell.\n\n      This module was tested successfully on Windows and Oracle Forms and Reports 10.1.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/oracle_reports_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/oracle_reports_rce"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ee4fd4bc-ec37-5eb1-9f95-406dfbf4a375"}}}
