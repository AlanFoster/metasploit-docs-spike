The payload is put on the server by\n        using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a\n        temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our\n        payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound\n        connections to us.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/jboss_maindeployer","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/jboss_maindeployer"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"48752b7e-5185-5d4e-ba89-8e349e95541c"}}}
