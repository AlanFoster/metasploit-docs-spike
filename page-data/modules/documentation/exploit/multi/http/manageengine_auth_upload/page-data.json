The JSP that accepts\n        the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write\n        to the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module\n        will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest\n        accounts. Alternatively, you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password.\n        For IT360 targets, enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All\n        versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer,\n        SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this\n        module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has\n        been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/manageengine_auth_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/manageengine_auth_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f7b856c5-d143-564b-aa67-315681cec307"}}}
