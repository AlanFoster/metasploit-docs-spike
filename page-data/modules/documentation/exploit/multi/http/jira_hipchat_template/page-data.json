A plugin is available\n        for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java\n        code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required\n        to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't\n        protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform,\n        but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows).\n\n        HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions\n        between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with\n        a vulnerable copy of HipChat.\n\n        When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module\n        will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to\n        passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled\n        with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable.\n\n        This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"1408531c-dba6-59e2-858a-fc218104e630"}}}
