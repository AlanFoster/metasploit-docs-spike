The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version\n        of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read\n        arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module\n        utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password\n        combination of the MySQL instance. With the\n        credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute\n        SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and\n        call it leading to remote code execution.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91835134-6d56-55c9-8a5b-aac5aa42e82f"}}}
