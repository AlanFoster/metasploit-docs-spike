By combining both\n        weaknesses a remote attacker can achieve remote code execution. This module has been\n        tested successfully on versions v7.0 - v9.9 b9002 in Windows and Linux. Versions\n        between 7.0 and < 8.1 are only exploitable via EAR deployment in the JBoss server,\n        while versions 8.1+ are only exploitable via a JSP upload.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/eventlog_file_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/eventlog_file_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ca698f6e-e4f7-5f37-bd77-14b28b7e6b2a"}}}
