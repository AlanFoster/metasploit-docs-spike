This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication\n          to any MT instance.\n          2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular\n          database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing\n          database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with\n          particular parameters.\n          3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows\n          a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval\n          statement, allowing perl code injection.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/movabletype_upgrade_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/movabletype_upgrade_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/movabletype_upgrade_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a73e293f-54d0-51e4-a0bb-5af80e755b91"}}}
