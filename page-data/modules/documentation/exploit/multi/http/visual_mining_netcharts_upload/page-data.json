Authentication is typically required, however a 'hidden' user is\n        available by default (and non-editable). This user, named 'Scheduler',\n        can only login to the console after any modification in the user\n        database (a user is added, admin password is changed etc). If the\n        'Scheduler' user isn't available valid credentials must be supplied. The\n        default Admin password is Admin.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/visual_mining_netcharts_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/visual_mining_netcharts_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/visual_mining_netcharts_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a852666e-4f96-5b83-853e-56ecba11548a"}}}
