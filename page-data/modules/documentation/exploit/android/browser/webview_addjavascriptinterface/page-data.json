The untrusted Javascript code can call into the Java Reflection\n          APIs exposed by the Interface and execute arbitrary commands.\n\n          Some distributions of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface\n          call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser app in the Google APIs\n          4.1.2 release of Android is known to be vulnerable.\n\n          A secondary attack vector involves the WebViews embedded inside a large number\n          of Android applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender here.\n          If you can MITM the WebView's HTTP connection, or if you can get a persistent XSS\n          into the page displayed in the WebView, then you can inject the html/js served\n          by this module and get a shell.\n\n          Note: Adding a .js to the URL will return plain javascript (no HTML markup).","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"35ceba36-634b-5175-a177-05f08ce84e9d"}}}
