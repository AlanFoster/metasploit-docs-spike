The Unified Maintenance Tool\n        contains a 'masterCGI' binary which allows an unauthenticated attacker\n        to execute arbitrary commands by specifying shell metacharaters as the\n        'user' within the 'ping' action to obtain 'httpd' user access. This\n        module only supports command line payloads, as the httpd process kills\n        the reverse/bind shell spawn after the HTTP 200 OK response.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/alcatel_omnipcx_mastercgi_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/alcatel_omnipcx_mastercgi_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ee87353d-7c81-5d8b-bc7d-c57c39ea795a"}}}
