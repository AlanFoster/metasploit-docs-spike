This allows any malicious user to upload a\n        script (such as PHP) without authentication, and then execute it with a GET request.\n\n          The issue is fixed in 1.1 by checking the extension name.  By default, 1.1 only\n        allows jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, but it is still possible to upload a PHP file as\n        one of those extension names, which may still be leveraged in an attack.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/vcms_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/vcms_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cc06c932-3bae-582c-9837-eaf07a84daa3"}}}
