Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin\n        or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there\n        is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping\n        command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module\n        overwrites parts of the PPOE configuration, while the module tries to restore it\n        after exploitation configuration backup is recommended.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/netgear_dgn2200b_pppoe_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/netgear_dgn2200b_pppoe_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/netgear_dgn2200b_pppoe_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"6b4316a4-3c36-5be6-89eb-0a4c21b4e53e"}}}
