This customized version has an unauthenticated command\n        injection vulnerability in the remote log forwarding page.\n        This module was tested in an emulated environment, as the author doesn't have access to the\n        Thai router any more. Any feedback should be sent directly to the module's author, as well as\n        to the Metasploit project.\n        There are other language strings in the firmware, so it is likely that this firmware is not only\n        distributed in Thailand. Other P660HN-T v1 in other countries might be vulnerable too.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/trueonline_p660hn_v1_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/trueonline_p660hn_v1_rce"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"bafde94b-0bcb-5ab4-b51d-7645f634a966"}}}
