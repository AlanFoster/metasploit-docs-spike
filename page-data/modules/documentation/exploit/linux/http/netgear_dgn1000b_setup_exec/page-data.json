The\n        vulnerability exists in the web interface, specifically in the setup.cgi component,\n        when handling the TimeToLive parameter. Default credentials are always a good\n        starting point, admin/admin or admin/password could be a first try. Since it is a\n        blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed\n        command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled\n        system could be used for testing purposes.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/netgear_dgn1000b_setup_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/netgear_dgn1000b_setup_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"9b5b515e-fa0f-5ba9-b3f0-08798f0ae219"}}}
