This module was tested against\n        a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping command against a\n        controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the wget\n        client from the device to convert the command injection into an arbitrary payload\n        execution.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/dlink_dir615_up_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/dlink_dir615_up_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/dlink_dir615_up_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a9ab0cd6-7b6b-5107-81c8-2ed174a760ce"}}}
