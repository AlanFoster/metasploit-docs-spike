By injecting PHP code in the access log, it is possible to load it\n        with a directory traversal flaw, which allows remote code execution under the\n        context of 'apache'. Please note that it may take up to several minutes to\n        retrieve access_log, which is about the amount of time required to see a shell\n        back.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f06bffc4-8080-52e4-bda6-9a6cc6e35380"}}}
