The pre-password set\nvulnerability uses a default password and a weak anti-CSRF (CVE-2015-4624)\ncheck to obtain shell by logging in and pre-computing the solution to\nthe anti-CSRF check.</p>\n<p>The post-password set vulnerability uses the fact that there is a 1 in 27\nchance of correctly guessing the challenge solution. This attack resets the\npassword to a password chosen by the attacker (we suggest the default\n'pineapplesareyummy' to decrease collateral damage on victims) and then\nperforms the same anti-CSRF attack as the pre-password vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This exploit uses a utility function in\n/components/system/configuration/functions.php to execute commands once\nauthorization has been bypassed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"verification-steps\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#verification-steps\" aria-label=\"verification steps permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Verification Steps</h2>\n<p>This exploit requires a \"fresh\" pineapple, flashed with version 2.0-2.3.
