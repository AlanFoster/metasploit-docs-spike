Once the stack\n        corruption has occurred it is possible to overwrite a pointer which is\n        later used for a memcpy. This gives us a write anything anywhere condition\n        similar to a format string vulnerability.\n\n        NOTE: The popsubfolders option is a non-default setting.\n\n        I chose to overwrite the GOT with my shellcode and return to it. This\n        defeats the VA random patch and possibly other stack protection features.\n\n        Tested on gentoo-sources Linux 2.6.16. Although Fedora CORE 5 ships with\n        a version containing the vulnerable code, it is not exploitable due to the\n        use of the FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler enhancement","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/pop3/cyrus_pop3d_popsubfolders","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/pop3/cyrus_pop3d_popsubfolders"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"d539ee55-6f48-52b1-84ee-af9bfaa479c4"}}}
