The vulnerability exists in the pmmasterd daemon, and can only\n        triggered when the host has been configured as a policy server (\n        Privilege Manager for Unix or Quest Sudo Plugin). A buffer overflow\n        condition exists when handling requests of type ACT_ALERT_EVENT, where\n        the size of a memcpy can be controlled by the attacker. This module\n        only works against version < 6.0.0-27. Versions up to 6.0.0-50 are also\n        vulnerable, but not supported by this module (a stack cookie bypass is\n        required). NOTE: To use this module it is required to be able to bind a\n        privileged port ( <=1024 ) as the server refuses connections coming\n        from unprivileged ports, which in most situations means that root\n        privileges are required.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"7b762633-c509-502f-8504-59176368ec56"}}}
