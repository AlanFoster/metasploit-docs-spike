A wp-nonce (CSRF token) is created on the backend index\n          page and the same token is used on handling ajax file uploads through\n          the plugin. By sending the captured nonce with the upload, we can\n          upload arbitrary files to the upload folder. Because the plugin also\n          uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress api it's\n          possible to upload any file type.\n          The user provided does not need special rights, and users with \"Contributor\"\n          role can be abused.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wptouch_file_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wptouch_file_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8db25693-40d0-58db-b2b8-8d7aa00e492b"}}}
