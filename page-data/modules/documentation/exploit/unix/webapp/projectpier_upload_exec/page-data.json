The application's\n        uploading tool does not require any authentication, which allows a malicious user\n        to upload an arbitrary file onto the web server, and then cause remote code\n        execution by simply requesting it. This module is known to work against Apache\n        servers due to the way it handles an extension name, but the vulnerability may\n        not be exploitable on others.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/projectpier_upload_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/projectpier_upload_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c8249119-f581-565b-a26f-c7535b63ed58"}}}
