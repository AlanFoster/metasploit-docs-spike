The first\n        vulnerability exposes the hash file (password.txt) to unauthenticated users.\n        The second vulnerability lies within the image upload system provided to\n        logged-in users; there is no image validation function in the blogger to\n        prevent an authenticated user from uploading any file type. The third\n        vulnerability occurs within the blog comment functionality, allowing\n        arbitrary files to be deleted.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/sphpblog_file_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/sphpblog_file_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ede6c866-b1a4-5b5d-8b95-d49a672479f6"}}}
