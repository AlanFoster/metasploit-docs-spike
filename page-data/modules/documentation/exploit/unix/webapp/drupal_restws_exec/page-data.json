Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code\n        under the context of the web server user.\n\n        RESTWS alters the default page callbacks for entities to provide\n        additional functionality. A vulnerability in this approach allows\n        an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests resulting\n        in arbitrary PHP execution. RESTWS 2.x prior to 2.6 and 1.x prior to 1.7\n        are affected by this issue.\n\n        This module was tested against RESTWS 2.5 with Drupal 7.5 installed on\n        Ubuntu Server.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_restws_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_restws_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_restws_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ef4d4da7-d72c-503c-bf6d-cc88c1d447df"}}}
