This flaw exists because the\n          /wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php script does not properly verify or\n          sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will\n          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the\n          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges\n          of the web server.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_symposium_shell_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_symposium_shell_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_symposium_shell_upload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"2499d904-c605-548a-a659-ecca4bf6f3bd"}}}
