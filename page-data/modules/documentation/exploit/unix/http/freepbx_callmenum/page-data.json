Also, the call\n        has to be answered (or go to voice).\n\n        Tested on both Elastix and FreePBX ISO image installs.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/http/freepbx_callmenum","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/http/freepbx_callmenum","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/http/freepbx_callmenum"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cf215db7-54f3-59f8-9e9a-20cdc572720c"}}}
