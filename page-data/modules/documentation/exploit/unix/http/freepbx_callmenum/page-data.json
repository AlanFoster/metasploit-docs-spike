Also, the call\n        has to be answered (or go to voice).\n\n        Tested on both Elastix and FreePBX ISO image installs.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/http/freepbx_callmenum","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/http/freepbx_callmenum"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ffc2b66e-6417-5d21-b382-32e0fea58b34"}}}
