If directly creating a service fails, this module will inspect\n        existing services to look for insecure file or configuration permissions that may\n        be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the replaced service to run the\n        payload. This will result in a new session when this succeeds.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/service_permissions","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/service_permissions"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"dbdb0b8e-bc58-532b-a8f8-4369d0076bf9"}}}
