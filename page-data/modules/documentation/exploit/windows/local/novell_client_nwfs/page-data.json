The corruption occurs while handling ioctl requests with code 0x1438BB,\n        where a 0x00000009 dword is written to an arbitrary address. An entry within the\n        HalDispatchTable is overwritten in order to execute arbitrary code when\n        NtQueryIntervalProfile is called. The module has been tested successfully on\n        Windows XP SP3 with Novell Client 4.91 SP4.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/novell_client_nwfs","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/novell_client_nwfs"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"5a138dfa-6d43-5aad-8b9e-6c5d6f01aa61"}}}
