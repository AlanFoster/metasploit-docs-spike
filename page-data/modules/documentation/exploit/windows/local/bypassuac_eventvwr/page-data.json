It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n        flag turned off.\n\n        This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n        been invoked.\n\n        The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If\n        specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your\n        payload in a separate process.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c88950fd-5476-5d33-8e6d-59036b76aab3"}}}
