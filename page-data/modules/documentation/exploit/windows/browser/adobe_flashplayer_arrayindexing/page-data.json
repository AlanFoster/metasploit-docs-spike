This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification\n        logic. This results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. This is the same\n        vulnerability that was used for attacks against Korean based organizations.\n\n          Specifically, this issue occurs when indexing an array using an arbitrary value,\n        memory can be referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue does not rely\n        on heap spraying as the vulnerability can also be used for information leakage.\n\n          Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 10.2 and likely several\n        other browsers under multiple Windows platforms. This exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP and\n        is very reliable.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_arrayindexing","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_arrayindexing","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_arrayindexing"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"d472bcd7-6b68-511f-8ffa-0173e7cbe015"}}}
