When parsing an HTML page containing a specially\n        crafted CSS tag, memory corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code\n        execution.\n\n        It seems like Microsoft code inadvertently increments a vtable pointer to\n        point to an unaligned address within the vtable's function pointers. This\n        leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the\n        address \"[vtable+0x30+1]\". The particular address depends on the exact\n        version of the mshtml library in use.\n\n        Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not\n        be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a program counter value\n        within another module, in kernel space, or just not able to be reached with\n        various memory spraying techniques.\n\n        Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible\n        to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_090_ie_css_clip","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_090_ie_css_clip"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f681992b-e25b-56aa-ad01-6caf31898280"}}}
