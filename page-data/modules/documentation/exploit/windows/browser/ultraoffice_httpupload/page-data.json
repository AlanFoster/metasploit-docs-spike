When processing the 'HttpUpload' method, the arguments are concatenated\n        together to form a command line to run a bundled version of cURL. If the command\n        fails to run, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs when building the error\n        message. This is due to the use of sprintf() without proper bounds checking.\n\n        NOTE: Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the payload\n        into memory unmodified.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ultraoffice_httpupload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ultraoffice_httpupload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ultraoffice_httpupload"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"dbdb0b8e-bc58-532b-a8f8-4369d0076bf9"}}}
