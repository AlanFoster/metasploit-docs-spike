It uses either JRE6 or an information leak (to ntdll) to\n        bypass ASLR, and by default the info leak is used. To make sure the leak is\n        successful, the ntdll version should be either v6.1.7601.17514 (the default dll\n        version on a newly installed/unpatched Windows 7 SP1), or ntdll.dll v6.1.7601.17725\n        (installed after apply MS12-001). If the target doesn't have the version the exploit\n        wants, it will refuse to attack by sending a fake 404 message (webpage not found).\n\n          If you wish to try the JRE6 component instead to bypass ASLR, you can set the\n        advanced datastore option to 'JRE6'. If JRE6 is chosen but the target doesn't\n        have this particular component, the exploit will also refuse to attack by\n        sending a 404 message.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms13_037_svg_dashstyle","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms13_037_svg_dashstyle","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms13_037_svg_dashstyle"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a71e74fe-a2d3-5757-a393-a6bfaec4a2fc"}}}
