The\n        player is a browser plugin for IE (ActiveX) and Firefox (dll). When an\n        unsuspecting user visits a web page referring to a specially crafted\n        .dxstudio document, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n        Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for Firefox 2.0.0.20\n        and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE, the user will be prompted if they\n        wish to allow the plug-in to access local files. This prompt appears to\n        occur only once per server host.\n\n        NOTE: This exploit uses additionally dangerous script features to write\n        to local files!","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/dxstudio_player_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/dxstudio_player_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a14291c0-42a7-5196-b77b-265662ff5faa"}}}
