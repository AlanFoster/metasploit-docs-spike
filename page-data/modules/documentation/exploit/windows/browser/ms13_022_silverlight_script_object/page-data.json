The vulnerability exists on\n        the Initialize() method from System.Windows.Browser.ScriptObject, which access memory in an\n        unsafe manner. Since it is accessible for untrusted code (user controlled) it's possible\n        to dereference arbitrary memory which easily leverages to arbitrary code execution. In order\n        to bypass DEP/ASLR a second vulnerability is used, in the public WriteableBitmap class\n        from System.Windows.dll. This module has been tested successfully on IE6 - IE10, Windows XP\n        SP3 / Windows 7 SP1.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms13_022_silverlight_script_object","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms13_022_silverlight_script_object"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"55d2deef-e1aa-59ef-b049-29ade0dd97c5"}}}
