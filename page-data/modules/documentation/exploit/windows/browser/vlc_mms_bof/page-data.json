The vulnerability is due to a dangerous use of sprintf which can result\n        in a stack buffer overflow when handling a malicious MMS URI.\n\n        This module uses the browser as attack vector. A specially crafted MMS URI is\n        used to trigger the overflow and get flow control through SEH overwrite. Control\n        is transferred to code located in the heap through a standard heap spray.\n\n        The module only targets IE6 and IE7 because no DEP/ASLR bypass has been provided.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/vlc_mms_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/vlc_mms_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/vlc_mms_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"3c704c94-1b40-53d6-95cd-3947571bafc6"}}}
