When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS\n        import, a C++ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary\n        code execution.\n\n        This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the\n        .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not\n        opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows\n        versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ffec8321-1092-5580-bb18-27804d3d92a4"}}}
