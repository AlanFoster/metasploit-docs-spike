By embedding a specially crafted .swf\n        file, Adobe Flash crashes due to an invalid use of an object type, which allows\n        attackers to overwrite a pointer in memory, and results arbitrary code execution.\n        Please note for IE 8 targets, Java Runtime Environment must be available on the\n        victim machine in order to work properly.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_flash10o","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_flash10o"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"71899dbb-5ef9-5417-b5a0-51525fc3a690"}}}
