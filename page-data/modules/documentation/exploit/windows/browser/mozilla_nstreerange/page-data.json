Sadly this exploit is still either dependent\n        on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free\n        modules anymore.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4aeb6737-b9ae-5269-b28e-78d0a45873a2"}}}
