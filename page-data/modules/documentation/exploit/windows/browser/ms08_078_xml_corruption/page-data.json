In order to execute code reliably, this module uses the .NET DLL\n      memory technique pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. This method is\n      used to create a fake vtable at a known location with all methods pointing\n      to our payload. Since the .text segment of the .NET DLL is non-writable, a\n      prefixed code stub is used to copy the payload into a new memory segment and\n      continue execution from there.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms08_078_xml_corruption","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms08_078_xml_corruption","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms08_078_xml_corruption"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"08d742ab-9d63-5575-91c8-16bab08ed2d7"}}}
