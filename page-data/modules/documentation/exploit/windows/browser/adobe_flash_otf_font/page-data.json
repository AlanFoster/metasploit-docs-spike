By supplying a specially crafted .otf font file\n        with a large nTables value in the 'kern' header, it is possible to trigger an\n        integer overflow, which results in remote code execution under the context of the\n        user.  This vulnerability has also been exploited in the wild in limited targeted\n        attacks.  Please note in order to ensure reliability, the exploit is forced to\n        modify your URIPATH parameter to less than 3 characters, which may cause possible\n        URIPATH collisions.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_otf_font","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_otf_font","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_otf_font"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f6c5e39d-584f-59f6-8238-755fa4e9d926"}}}
