Parameters initial-heap-size and max-heap-size in a JNLP\n        file can contain a double quote which is not properly sanitized when creating\n        the command line for javaw.exe. This allows the injection of the -XXaltjvm\n        option to load a jvm.dll from a remote UNC path into the java process. Thus\n        an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a browser user.\n        This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07.\n\n        In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that\n        does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts). Additionally,\n        the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.\n        Alternatively, a UNC path containing a jvm.dll can be specified, bypassing\n        the Windows limitation for the Metasploit host.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/java_ws_double_quote","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/java_ws_double_quote","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/java_ws_double_quote"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f13cbaa2-ea8d-5d60-8a9e-2f12d23d3e49"}}}
