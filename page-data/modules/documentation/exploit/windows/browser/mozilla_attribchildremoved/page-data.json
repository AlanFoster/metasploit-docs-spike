Since mFirstChild is not set to NULL until\n        after this call is made, this means the removed child will be accessible\n        after it has been removed. By carefully manipulating the memory layout,\n        this can lead to arbitrary code execution.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_attribchildremoved","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_attribchildremoved"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"92420bfc-72bd-579e-b4e9-1a59356fd43b"}}}
