When the\n        user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use\n        a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server.\n\n        This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will\n        serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the\n        payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module\n        might use other methods that do not create such a warning.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"87a1dcfb-6045-56fd-a14a-c17a8595ca1a"}}}
