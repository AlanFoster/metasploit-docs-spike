This code is based on Johnny\n        Cyberpunk's THC release and has been tested against Windows\n        2000 and Windows XP. To use this module, specify the remote\n        port of any SSL service, or the port and protocol of an\n        application that uses SSL. The only application protocol\n        supported at this time is SMTP. You only have one chance to\n        select the correct target, if you are attacking IIS, you may\n        want to try one of the other exploits first (WebDAV). If\n        WebDAV does not work, this more than likely means that this\n        is either Windows 2000 SP4+ or Windows XP (IIS 5.0 vs IIS\n        5.1). Using the wrong target may not result in an immediate\n        crash of the remote system.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ssl/ms04_011_pct","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ssl/ms04_011_pct","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ssl/ms04_011_pct"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ea350d59-9ea0-584d-b15c-28c06a63dfee"}}}
