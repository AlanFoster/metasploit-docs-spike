By\n          supplying a long username, the SSH server will copy that data on the stack\n          without proper bounds checking, therefore allowing remote code execution\n          under the context of the user.  Please note that previous versions\n          (before 5.53) are also affected by this bug.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ssh/sysax_ssh_username","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ssh/sysax_ssh_username","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ssh/sysax_ssh_username"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3ebd311-e96d-5e93-8a85-82641904ca64"}}}
