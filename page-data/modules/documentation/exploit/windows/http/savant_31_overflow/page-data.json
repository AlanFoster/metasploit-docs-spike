The service\n        supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt\n        generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default\n        configuration, you only have 10 chances.\n\n        Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the\n        \"ord\" payloads is recommended.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/savant_31_overflow","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/savant_31_overflow"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f7a1b602-e7c5-51c2-8db9-6c52cc48f61e"}}}
