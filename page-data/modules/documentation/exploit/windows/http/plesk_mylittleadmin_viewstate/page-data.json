This exploit caters to the Plesk target, though it\n          should work fine against a standalone myLittleAdmin setup.\n\n          Successful exploitation results in code execution as the user running\n          myLittleAdmin, which is IUSRPLESK_sqladmin for Plesk and described as\n          the \"SQL Admin MSSQL anonymous account.\"\n\n          Tested on the latest Plesk Obsidian with optional myLittleAdmin 3.8.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/plesk_mylittleadmin_viewstate","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/plesk_mylittleadmin_viewstate","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/plesk_mylittleadmin_viewstate"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"148f483c-6ada-5428-aa39-04d97c7fe469"}}}
