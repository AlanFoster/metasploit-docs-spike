This exploit has to deal with the fact that the application's request handler\n        thread is terminated after 60 seconds by a \"monitor\" thread. To do this, it allocates\n        some RWX memory, copies the payload to it and creates another thread. When done, it\n        terminates the current thread so that it doesn't crash and hence doesn't bring down\n        the process with it.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4f2e0c87-c223-560c-af5b-25e0238f6878"}}}
