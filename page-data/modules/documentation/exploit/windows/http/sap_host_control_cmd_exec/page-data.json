Because of this,\n        the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.\n        It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3, but disabled\n        by default on Windows 2003 SP2.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/sap_host_control_cmd_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/sap_host_control_cmd_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"15cde2e3-60ad-589a-92e9-c8d6e09a3463"}}}
