By supplying a\n        long string of data to the URL, an overflow may occur if the data gets handled\n        by HTTP Server's active window.  In other words, in order to gain remote code\n        execution, the victim is probably looking at HttpSvr's window.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/netdecision_http_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/netdecision_http_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/netdecision_http_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"89630cfd-81d6-53a5-a5d6-bf05eb4977d8"}}}
