This flaw is triggered by any HTTP\n        request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes.\n        To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first\n        pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the\n        large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current\n        encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c8fdf5e5-ed12-5ab3-8083-562bba3f002a"}}}
