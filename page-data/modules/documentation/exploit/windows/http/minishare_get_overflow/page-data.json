This flaw affects all versions prior to 1.4.2. This\n        is a plain stack buffer overflow that requires a \"jmp esp\" to reach\n        the payload, making this difficult to target many platforms\n        at once. This module has been successfully tested against\n        1.4.1. Version 1.3.4 and below do not seem to be vulnerable.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/minishare_get_overflow","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/minishare_get_overflow","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/minishare_get_overflow"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8178fa41-f581-5b7b-b01b-e1b7f9e766bf"}}}
