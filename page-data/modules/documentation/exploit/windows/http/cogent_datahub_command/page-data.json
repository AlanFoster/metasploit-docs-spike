The vulnerability exists in the GetPermissions.asp page, which\n        makes insecure use of the datahub_command function with user controlled\n        data, allowing execution of arbitrary datahub commands and scripts. This\n        module has been tested successfully with Cogent DataHub 7.3.4 on\n        Windows 7 SP1. Please also note that after exploitation, the remote service\n        will most likely hang and restart manually.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/cogent_datahub_command","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/cogent_datahub_command"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"81874f61-6ad0-5646-b03f-51633deb21da"}}}
