SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path\n        traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible\n        /umbraco/ directory.\n\n        The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that\n        though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic\n        cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows\n        7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the \"IIS APPPOOL\\ASP.NET v4.0\" user must have\n        write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8b8d324e-06f3-5a72-a1bd-1296a83dc08e"}}}
