By making a specially crafted HTTP request to the \"snmpviewer.exe\"\n        CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary\n        code.\n\n        The vulnerable code lies within a function within \"snmpviewer.exe\" with a\n        timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET\n        or POST request. The request must contain 'act' and 'app' parameters which, when\n        combined, total more than the 1024 byte stack buffer can hold.\n\n        It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH.\n        While the saved return address can be smashed, a function call that occurs before\n        the function returns calls \"exit\".","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_snmpviewer_actapp","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_snmpviewer_actapp"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a7ee7e69-9482-5200-a093-273701fb99aa"}}}
