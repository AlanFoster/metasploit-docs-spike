The static-sized stack buffer is\n        declared within this function. When the vulnerability is triggered, the stack trace looks\n        like the following:\n\n          #0 ...\n          #1 sprintf_new(local_stack_buf, fmt, cookie);\n          #2 OvWwwDebug(\"   HTTP_COOKIE=%s\\n\", cookie);\n          #3 ?OvWwwInit@@YAXAAHQAPADPBD@Z(x, x, x);\n          #4 sub_405ee0(\"nnm\", \"webappmon\");\n\n        No validation is done on the cookie argument. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation\n        is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame.\n\n        The original advisory detailed an attack vector using the \"OvJavaLocale\" cookie being\n        passed in a request to \"webappmon.exe\". Further research shows that several different\n        cookie values, as well as several different CGI applications, can be used.\n      '","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_ovjavalocale","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_ovjavalocale","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_ovjavalocale"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"51d90b98-c5a0-5086-975e-d7135cd49a71"}}}
