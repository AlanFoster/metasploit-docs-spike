By sending a specially\n        crafted FunnelConnect request, an attacker can execute arbitrary code\n        under the \"NetShowServices\" user account. Windows Media Services 4.1 ships\n        with Windows 2000 Server, but is not installed by default.\n\n        NOTE: This service does NOT restart automatically. Successful, as well as\n        unsuccessful exploitation attempts will kill the service which prevents\n        additional attempts.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"264d79d3-56ef-576b-ae05-3a8806606d5c"}}}
