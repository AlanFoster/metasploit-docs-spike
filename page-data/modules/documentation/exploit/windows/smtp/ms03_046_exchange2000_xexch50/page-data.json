Due\n        to the nature of the vulnerability, this exploit is not very\n        reliable. This module has been tested against Exchange 2000\n        SP0 and SP3 running a Windows 2000 system patched to SP4. It\n        normally takes between one and 100 connection attempts to\n        successfully obtain a shell. This exploit is *very* unreliable.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/smtp/ms03_046_exchange2000_xexch50","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/smtp/ms03_046_exchange2000_xexch50"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cbf4eaa3-4de3-58aa-b24b-ce193a97571a"}}}
