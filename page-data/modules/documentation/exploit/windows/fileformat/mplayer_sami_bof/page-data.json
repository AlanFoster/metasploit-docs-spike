It currently\n        targets SMPlayer 0.6.8, which is distributed with a vulnerable version of MPlayer.\n\n        The overflow is triggered when an unsuspecting victim opens a movie file first,\n        followed by loading the malicious SAMI subtitles file from the GUI. Or, it can also\n        be done from the console with the MPlayer \"-sub\" option.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/mplayer_sami_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/mplayer_sami_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/mplayer_sami_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"d60a9901-cd7f-5136-9616-4430bed23fb5"}}}
