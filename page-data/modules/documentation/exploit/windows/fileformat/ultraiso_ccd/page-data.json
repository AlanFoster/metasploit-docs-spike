When processing .CCD files, data is read from file into a\n        fixed-size stack buffer. Since no bounds checking is done, a buffer overflow\n        can occur. Attackers can execute arbitrary code by convincing their victim\n        to open an CCD file.\n\n        NOTE: A file with the same base name, but the extension of \"img\" must also\n        exist. Opening either file will trigger the vulnerability, but the files must\n        both exist.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/ultraiso_ccd","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/ultraiso_ccd","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/ultraiso_ccd"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"015d27bd-b4d7-5038-b6cd-ec7388fab4aa"}}}
