The vulnerability exists in the handling of the Screen Saver path, in the [boot]\n        section. An arbitrary path can be used as screen saver, including a remote SMB resource,\n        which allows for remote code execution when a malicious .theme file is opened, and the\n        \"Screen Saver\" tab is viewed. The code execution is also triggered if the victim installs\n        the malicious theme and stays away from the computer, when Windows tries to display the\n        screensaver.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms13_071_theme","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms13_071_theme"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"d98138f8-c510-5298-8995-9b62c893e04c"}}}
