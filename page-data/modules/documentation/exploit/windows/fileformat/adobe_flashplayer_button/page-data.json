Adobe Reader and Acrobat\n        are also vulnerable, as are any other applications that may embed Flash player.\n\n        Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash\n        movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure\n        that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.\n\n        NOTE: This module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the\n        adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various\n        Windows versions due to a hardcoded syscall number.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_button","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_button"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"8b8e4db8-5255-5dd8-9214-6791eff3f4d8"}}}
