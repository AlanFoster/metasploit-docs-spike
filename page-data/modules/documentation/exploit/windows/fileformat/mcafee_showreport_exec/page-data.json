However, if the victim machine is connected to a remote share\n        (or something similar), then it's also possible to execute arbitrary code.\n        Please note that a custom template is required for the payload, because the\n        default Metasploit template is detectable by McAfee -- any Windows binary, such\n        as calc.exe or notepad.exe, should bypass McAfee fine.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"67c874b3-977f-512c-b69e-079e9752e1d7"}}}
