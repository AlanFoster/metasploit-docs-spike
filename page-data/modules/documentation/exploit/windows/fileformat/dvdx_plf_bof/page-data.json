By supplying a long string of data in a plf file (playlist), the\n        MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component will attempt to extract a filename out of the string,\n        and then copy it on the stack without any proper bounds checking, which causes a\n        buffer overflow, and results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.\n\n          This module has been designed to target common Windows systems such as:\n        Windows XP SP2/SP3, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/dvdx_plf_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/dvdx_plf_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/dvdx_plf_bof"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"e447f0ad-a8d3-5a44-b5f2-f05a58aa0950"}}}
