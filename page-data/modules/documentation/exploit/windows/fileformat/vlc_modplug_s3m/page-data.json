All versions prior to version 1.1.9\n        are affected. By creating a malicious S3M file, a remote attacker\n        could execute arbitrary code.\n\n        Although other products that bundle libmodplug may be vulnerable, this\n        module was only tested against VLC.\n\n        NOTE: As of July 1st, 2010, VLC now calls SetProcessDEPPoly to\n        permanently enable NX support on machines that support it. As such,\n        this module is capable of bypassing DEP, but not ASLR.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/vlc_modplug_s3m","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/vlc_modplug_s3m","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/vlc_modplug_s3m"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"19bec467-a948-586b-bdc0-b319558a9f3d"}}}
