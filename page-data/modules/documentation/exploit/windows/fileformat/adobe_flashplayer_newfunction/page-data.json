Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also\n        vulnerable, as are any other applications that may embed Flash player.\n\n        Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash\n        movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure\n        that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.\n\n        NOTE: This module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the\n        adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various\n        Windows versions due a the hardcoded syscall number.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c9bb370-c8be-5049-bf15-c71b34316f40"}}}
