The\n        payload is encoded in base64 and executed from the commandline using the -encodedcommand\n        flag. Using this method, the payload is never written to disk, and given that each payload\n        is unique, is less prone to signature based detection. A persist option is provided to\n        execute the payload in a while loop in order to maintain a form of persistence. In the\n        event of a sandbox observing PSH execution, a delay and other obfuscation may be added to\n        avoid detection. In order to avoid interactive process notifications for the current user,\n        the psh payload has been reduced in size and wrapped in a powershell invocation which hides\n        the window entirely.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"705562f9-d956-5ed5-8f6b-aa083d9e9e81"}}}
