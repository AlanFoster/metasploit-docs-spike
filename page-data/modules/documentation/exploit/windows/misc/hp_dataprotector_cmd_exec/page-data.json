Arbitrary\n        commands can be executed by sending crafted requests with opcode 28 to the OmniInet\n        service listening on the TCP/5555 port. Since there is a strict length limitation on\n        the command, rundll32.exe is executed, and the payload is provided through a DLL by a\n        fake SMB server. This module has been tested successfully on HP Data Protector 8.1 on\n        Windows 7 SP1.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_cmd_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_cmd_exec"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"498d36a6-f8ef-57be-82e4-c5a9705f0f08"}}}
