The RAW\n        Server can be used to transfer fax messages without any underlying protocols. To\n        note significant fields in the fax being transferred, like the fax number or the\n        recipient, ActFax data fields can be used. This module exploits a buffer overflow\n        in the handling of the @F506 fields due to the insecure usage of strcpy.
