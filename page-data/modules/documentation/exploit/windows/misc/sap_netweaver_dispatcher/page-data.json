The overflow occurs in the DiagTraceR3Info() function and allows a remote\n        attacker to execute arbitrary code by supplying a special crafted Diag packet. The\n        Dispatcher service is only vulnerable if the Developer Traces have been configured\n        at levels 2 or 3. The module has been successfully tested on SAP Netweaver 7.0 EHP2\n        SP6 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2 (DEP bypass).","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"daddca7c-89a7-57d9-a1af-5ad9c827a63c"}}}
