No credential is actually\n        needed to login; 2. User's default path is in C:\\, and this cannot be changed;\n        3. User can write to anywhere on the server's file system.  As a result of these\n        poor implementations, a malicious user can just log in and then upload files,\n        and let WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the payload uploaded.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/freefloatftp_wbem","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/freefloatftp_wbem"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"e6b79509-e6d2-5bee-97cb-605c77418329"}}}
