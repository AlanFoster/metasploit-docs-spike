EasyFTP fails to check input size when parsing 'MKD' commands, which\n        leads to a stack based buffer overflow.\n\n        NOTE: EasyFTP allows anonymous access by default. However, in order to access the\n        'MKD' command, you must have access to an account that can create directories.\n\n        After version 1.7.0.12, this package was renamed \"UplusFtp\".\n\n        This exploit utilizes a small piece of code that I\\'ve referred to as 'fixRet'.\n        This code allows us to inject of payload of ~500 bytes into a 264 byte buffer by\n        'fixing' the return address post-exploitation.
