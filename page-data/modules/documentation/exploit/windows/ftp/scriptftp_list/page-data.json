Social engineering of executing a specially crafted\n        ftp file by double click will result in connecting to our malicious\n        server and perform arbitrary code execution which allows the attacker to\n        gain the same rights as the user running ScriptFTP. This vulnerability\n        affects versions 3.3 and earlier.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/scriptftp_list","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/scriptftp_list","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ftp/scriptftp_list"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"ad06fc70-3b61-5212-86fe-f8a7707e2013"}}}
