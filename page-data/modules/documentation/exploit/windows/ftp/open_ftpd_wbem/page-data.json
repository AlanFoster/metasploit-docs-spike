The software contains an authentication bypass vulnerability and a\n        arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write\n        arbitrary files to the file system as long as there is at least one user\n        who has permission.\n\n        Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote\n        machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables\n        WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload.\n        Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/open_ftpd_wbem","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/open_ftpd_wbem"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"408819ef-4c31-55f9-9912-dadda04b0664"}}}
