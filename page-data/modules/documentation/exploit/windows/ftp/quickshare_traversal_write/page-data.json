By supplying \"../\" in the file path, it is possible to trigger a\n        directory traversal flaw, allowing the attacker to read a file outside the\n        virtual directory.  By default, the \"Writable\" option is enabled during account\n        creation, therefore this makes it possible to create a file at an arbitrary\n        location, which leads to remote code execution.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/quickshare_traversal_write","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/quickshare_traversal_write","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ftp/quickshare_traversal_write"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"5cc4c59c-5ae5-59d3-ba1f-da345b47d416"}}}
