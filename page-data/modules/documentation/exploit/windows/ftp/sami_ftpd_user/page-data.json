The stack is overwritten\n        when the administrator attempts to view the FTP logs. Therefore, this exploit\n        is passive and requires end-user interaction. Keep this in mind when selecting\n        payloads. When the server is restarted, it will re-execute the exploit until\n        the logfile is manually deleted via the file system.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"84218f61-9a2e-56ea-bb89-11d73c9acb2a"}}}
