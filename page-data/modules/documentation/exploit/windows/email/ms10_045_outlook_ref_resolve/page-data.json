Through specially crafted TNEF\n        streams with certain MAPI attachment properties, it is possible to set a path name\n        to files to be executed. When a user double clicks on such an attachment or message,\n        Outlook will proceed to execute the file that is set by the path name value. These\n        files can be local files, but also file stored remotely for example on a file share.\n        Exploitation is limited by the fact that its is not possible for attackers to supply\n        command line options.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/email/ms10_045_outlook_ref_resolve","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/email/ms10_045_outlook_ref_resolve","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/email/ms10_045_outlook_ref_resolve"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"81bc9096-9ebf-51de-b354-fcf9491f2dba"}}}
