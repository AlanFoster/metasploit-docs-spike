Currently, this module supports relaying to SMB and HTTP.\n\n          Complicated custom attacks requiring multiple requests that depend on each\n          other can be written using the SYNC* options. For example, a CSRF-style\n          attack might first set an HTTP_GET request with a unique SNYNCID and set\n          an HTTP_POST request with a SYNCFILE, which contains logic to look\n          through the database and parse out important values, such as the CSRF token\n          or authentication cookies, setting these as configuration options, and finally\n          create a web page with iframe elements pointing at the HTTP_GET and HTTP_POSTs.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/server/http_ntlmrelay","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/server/http_ntlmrelay","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/server/http_ntlmrelay"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c1d6e3d7-593d-53a0-b817-2b8078ab7c3a"}}}
