When used in\n        combination with HTML5 sandbox iframes it is possible to use this behavior to\n        find out if a local file exists. This technique only works on Internet Explorer\n        10 & 11 since these support the HTML5 sandbox. Also it is not possible to do\n        this from a regular website as file:// URLs are blocked all together. The attack\n        must be performed locally (works with Internet zone Mark of the Web) or from a\n        share.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/ie_sandbox_findfiles","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/ie_sandbox_findfiles"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4dc8c018-49bd-5999-8ba8-45cf0b4ea1b5"}}}
