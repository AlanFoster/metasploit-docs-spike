If successful, an attacker can leverage this bug\n        to scrape both cookie data and page contents from a vulnerable browser window.\n\n        If your target URLs use X-Frame-Options, you can enable the \"BYPASS_XFO\" option,\n        which will cause a popup window to be used. This requires a click from the user\n        and is much less stealthy, but is generally harmless-looking.\n\n        By supplying a CUSTOM_JS parameter and ensuring CLOSE_POPUP is set to false, this\n        module also allows running aribtrary javascript in the context of the targeted URL.\n        Some sample UXSS scripts are provided in data/exploits/uxss.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/android_stock_browser_uxss","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/android_stock_browser_uxss","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/gather/android_stock_browser_uxss"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"b3d65db4-ec61-5ba6-a4d3-b40acaf103a6"}}}
