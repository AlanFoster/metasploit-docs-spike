The device has two different access control\n        modes: OnScreen and Password. The difference between the two is the\n        password in OnScreen mode is numeric-only and four digits long, which\n        means when this option is enabled, this option, the module will make\n        sure to cover all of them - from 0000 to 9999.  The Password mode is\n        more complex, therefore the usual online bruteforce strategies apply.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb27bcc8-6d4f-5c82-af1b-31ba50252eb4"}}}
