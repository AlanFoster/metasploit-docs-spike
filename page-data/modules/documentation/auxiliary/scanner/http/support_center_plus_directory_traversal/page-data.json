By requesting our\n        own attachment, it's possible to retrieve any file on the filesystem with the same\n        privileges as Support Center Plus is running. On Windows this is always with SYSTEM\n        privileges.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/support_center_plus_directory_traversal","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/support_center_plus_directory_traversal"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"5aa81c98-5d03-5a1b-b0df-1aee869c80cb"}}}
