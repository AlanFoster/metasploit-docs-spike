The 'DOWNLOAD' action shares the same ability as\n        'CHECK', but will take advantage of the found trigger to download files based on\n        a 'FILELIST' of your choosing.  The 'PHPSOURCE' action can be used to download\n        source against PHP applications.  The 'WRITABLE' action can be used to determine\n        if the trigger can be used to write files outside the www directory.\n\n          To use the 'COOKIE' option, set your value like so: \"name=value\".","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/http_traversal","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/http_traversal"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"72e8ae72-1c5f-5568-a6ee-00aa1377ccb2"}}}
