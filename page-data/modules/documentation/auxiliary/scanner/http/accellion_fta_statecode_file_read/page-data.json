This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided\n        'statecode' cookie parameter is appended to a file path that is processed as\n        a HTML template. By prepending this cookie with directory traversal sequence\n        and appending a NULL byte, any file readable by the web user can be exposed.\n        The web user has read access to a number of sensitive files, including the\n        system configuration and files uploaded to the appliance by users.\n        This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous\n        versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/accellion_fta_statecode_file_read","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/accellion_fta_statecode_file_read","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/http/accellion_fta_statecode_file_read"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"aee0e930-97e1-57d2-b8e7-c1d9e8d8d5c9"}}}
