This module\n          sends these Crypto-NAK packets in order to establish an association\n          between the target ntpd instance and the attacking client.  The end goal\n          is to cause ntpd to declare the legitimate peers \"false tickers\" and\n          choose the attacking clients as the preferred peers, allowing\n          these peers to control time.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/ntp/ntp_nak_to_the_future","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/ntp/ntp_nak_to_the_future"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"db46801c-3fad-5ec7-9be2-f482b11d0ab4"}}}
