This does not always happen, but at least the first 4\n        bytes in the return-packet should be exact the same as what was sent.\n\n        You can change port, ip and the scan-range for unit-id. There is also added a\n        value - BENICE - to make the scanner sleep a second or more between probes. We\n        have seen installations where scanning too many too fast works like a DoS.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbus_findunitid","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbus_findunitid"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f2868fac-4b2e-5ccf-9657-3108e14b34e2"}}}
