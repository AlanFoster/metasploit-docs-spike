Other similar IP Cameras such as Edimax,\n        Hawking, Zonet, etc, are also believed to have the same flaw, but not fully tested.\n        The protocol design issue also allows attackers to reset passwords on the device.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/misc/rosewill_rxs3211_passwords","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/misc/rosewill_rxs3211_passwords","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/misc/rosewill_rxs3211_passwords"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"25da1edd-d7e0-5045-9f27-ef3583c5390a"}}}
