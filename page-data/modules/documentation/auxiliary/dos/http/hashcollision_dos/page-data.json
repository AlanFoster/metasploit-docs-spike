This vulnerability occurs when storing multiple values\n        in a hash table and all values have the same hash value. This can cause a web server\n        parsing the POST parameters issued with a request into a hash table to consume\n        hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.\n\n        Currently, only the hash functions for PHP and Java are implemented.\n        This module was tested with PHP + httpd, Tomcat, Glassfish and Geronimo.\n        It also generates a random payload to bypass some IDS signatures.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollision_dos","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollision_dos"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"52642778-d515-57bc-9964-197102c8040a"}}}
