Furthermore, this module is not\n        particularly intelligent and there are many more areas of NTP that\n        could be explored, including:\n\n        * Warn if the response is 100% identical to the request\n        * Warn if the \"mode\" (if applicable) doesn't align with what we expect,\n        * Filter out the 12-byte mode 6 unsupported opcode errors.\n        * Fuzz the control message payload offset/size/etc.  There be bugs","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/fuzzers/ntp/ntp_protocol_fuzzer","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/fuzzers/ntp/ntp_protocol_fuzzer"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4378912f-e58d-5705-ae45-e60495b4e6b4"}}}
