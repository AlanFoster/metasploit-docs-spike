First, an\n        information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2015-2997) is used to obtain the file\n        system path, and then we abuse a directory traversal (CVE-2015-2996) to download\n        the file. Note that there are some limitations on Windows, in that the information\n        disclosure vulnerability doesn't work on a Windows platform, and we can only\n        traverse the current drive (if you enter C:\\afile.txt and the server is running\n        on D:\\ the file will not be downloaded).\n\n        This module has been tested with SysAid 14.4 on Windows and Linux.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/sysaid_file_download","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/sysaid_file_download"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c1f76ee3-d9d7-51ea-bb6a-f992b230cebe"}}}
