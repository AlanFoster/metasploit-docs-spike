It should also work with the hardware revisions v4 and v3, but this\n        has not been tested.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"e85f056a-7a74-5630-a988-9670647c2e1e"}}}
