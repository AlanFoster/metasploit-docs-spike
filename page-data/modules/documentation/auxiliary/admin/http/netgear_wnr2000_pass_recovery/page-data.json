It should also work with the hardware revisions v4 and v3, but this\n        has not been tested.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"835d1bfc-6682-5550-a640-13c2110077cc"}}}
