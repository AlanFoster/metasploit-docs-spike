Due to a lack of authentication on the\n          webctrl.cgi script, unauthenticated attackers can recover the\n          administrator password for these devices. The vulnerable device\n          has reached end of life for support from the manufacturer, so it is\n          unlikely this problem will be addressed.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/zyxel_admin_password_extractor","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/zyxel_admin_password_extractor"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4addcdc2-4344-5605-908d-dc8a5a72f207"}}}
