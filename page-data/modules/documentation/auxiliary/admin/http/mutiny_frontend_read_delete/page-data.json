The EditDocument servlet provides file operations, such as copy and\n        delete, which are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of this,\n        any authenticated frontend user can read and delete arbitrary files from the system\n        with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role)\n        in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the\n        Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/mutiny_frontend_read_delete","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/mutiny_frontend_read_delete"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"4e114127-b2ff-577f-a000-60102f9411d2"}}}
