If the file\n        is found, the process will then go ahead execute it with CreateProcess()\n        under a new thread.  If the filename isn't found, FindFirstFileW() will throw\n        an error (0x03), and then bails early without triggering CreateProcess().\n\n        Because of these behaviors, if you try to supply an argument, FindFirstFileW()\n        will look at that as part of the filename, and then bail.\n\n        Please note that when you specify the 'CMD' option, the base path begins\n        under C:\\.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/hp/hp_data_protector_cmd","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/hp/hp_data_protector_cmd"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"58a0c26d-1d6a-5928-ad2f-f3350cbef1d1"}}}
