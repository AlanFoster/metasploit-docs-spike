This could be useful when you need to download some file on the victim\n        machine and then delete it without leaving clues about its contents. Note that the script\n        does not wipe the free disk space so temporary/sparse/encrypted/compressed files could\n        not be overwritten. Note too that MTF entries are not overwritten so very small files\n        could stay resident within the stream descriptor.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/post/windows/manage/sdel","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/post/windows/manage/sdel"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"eaeeb012-a676-522a-9b10-a9daeb943e5f"}}}
