Additionally, cookies are downloaded. Which\n        could potentially yield valid web sessions.\n\n        Firefox stores passwords within the signons.sqlite database file. There is also a\n        keys3.db file which contains the key for decrypting these passwords. In cases where\n        a Master Password has not been set, the passwords can easily be decrypted using\n        3rd party tools or by setting the DECRYPT option to true. Using the latter often\n        needs root privileges. Also be warned that if your session dies in the middle of the\n        file renaming process, this could leave Firefox in a non working state. If a\n        Master Password was used the only option would be to bruteforce.\n\n        Useful 3rd party tools:\n        + firefox_decrypt (https://github.com/Unode/firefox_decrypt)\n        + pswRecovery4Moz (https://github.com/philsmd/pswRecovery4Moz)","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/post/multi/gather/firefox_creds","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/post/multi/gather/firefox_creds"},"documentation":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"83cf562b-14f4-592a-9d25-82ae75580c08"}}}
