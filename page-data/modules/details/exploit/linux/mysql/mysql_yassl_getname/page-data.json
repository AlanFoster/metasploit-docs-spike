By sending a specially crafted\n        client certificate, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.\n\n        This vulnerability is present within the CertDecoder::GetName function inside\n        \"taocrypt/src/asn.cpp\". However, the stack buffer that is written to exists\n        within a parent function's stack frame.\n\n        NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker\n        must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be\n        configured to listen on an accessible network interface.  Lastly, the server\n        must have been manually configured to use SSL.\n\n        The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing\n        on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation.\n\n        Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is\n        present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary\n        package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature.\n\n        Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they\n        provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_getname","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_getname"},"author":["jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"name":"WfsDelay","required":false,"default":"0","description":"Additional delay when waiting for a session"},{"name":"EnableContextEncoding","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Use transient context when encoding payloads"},{"name":"ContextInformationFile","required":false,"default":"","description":"The information file that contains context information"},{"name":"DisablePayloadHandler","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Disable the handler code for the selected payload"},{"name":"RHOSTS","required":true,"default":"","description":"The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'"},{"name":"RPORT","required":true,"default":"3306","description":"The target port"},{"name":"SSL","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connections"},{"name":"SSLVersion","required":true,"default":"Auto","description":"Specify the version of SSL/TLS to be used (Auto, TLS and SSL23 are auto-negotiate) (Accepted: Auto, TLS, SSL23, SSL3, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2)"},{"name":"SSLVerifyMode","required":false,"default":"PEER","description":"SSL verification method (Accepted: CLIENT_ONCE, FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT, NONE, PEER)"},{"name":"SSLCipher","required":false,"default":"","description":"String for SSL cipher - \"DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA\" or \"ADH\""},{"name":"Proxies","required":false,"default":"","description":"A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]"},{"name":"CPORT","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client port"},{"name":"CHOST","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client address"},{"name":"ConnectTimeout","required":true,"default":"10","description":"Maximum number of seconds to establish a TCP connection"},{"name":"TCP::max_send_size","required":false,"default":"0","description":"Maxiumum tcp segment size.
