Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also\n        vulnerable, as are any other applications that may embed Flash player.\n\n        Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash\n        movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure\n        that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.\n\n        NOTE: This module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the\n        adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various\n        Windows versions due a the hardcoded syscall number.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction"},"author":["Unknown","jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"name":"WfsDelay","required":false,"default":"0","description":"Additional delay when waiting for a session"},{"name":"EnableContextEncoding","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Use transient context when encoding payloads"},{"name":"ContextInformationFile","required":false,"default":"","description":"The information file that contains context information"},{"name":"DisablePayloadHandler","required":false,"default":"true","description":"Disable the handler code for the selected payload"},{"name":"FILENAME","required":true,"default":"msf.pdf","description":"The file name."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c9bb370-c8be-5049-bf15-c71b34316f40"}}}
