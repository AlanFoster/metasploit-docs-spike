By sending an overly long transfer-mode string, we were able\n        to overwrite both the SEH and the saved EIP. A subsequent write-exception\n        that will occur allows the transferring of execution to our shellcode\n        via the overwritten SEH. This module has been tested against Windows\n        2000 Professional and for some reason does not seem to work against\n        Windows 2000 Server (could not trigger the overflow at all).","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/tftp/futuresoft_transfermode","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/tftp/futuresoft_transfermode"},"author":["MC <mc@metasploit.com>"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"name":"WfsDelay","required":false,"default":"0","description":"Additional delay when waiting for a session"},{"name":"EnableContextEncoding","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Use transient context when encoding payloads"},{"name":"ContextInformationFile","required":false,"default":"","description":"The information file that contains context information"},{"name":"DisablePayloadHandler","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Disable the handler code for the selected payload"},{"name":"RHOSTS","required":true,"default":"","description":"The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'"},{"name":"RPORT","required":true,"default":"69","description":"The target port"},{"name":"CPORT","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client port"},{"name":"CHOST","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client address"},{"name":"DynamicSehRecord","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Generate a dynamic SEH record (more stealthy)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a3d015a0-f8ba-5dbd-88ee-af4ef721e5b8"}}}
