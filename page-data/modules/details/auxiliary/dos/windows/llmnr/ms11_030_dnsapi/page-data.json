By sending a\n        specially crafted LLMNR query, containing a leading '.' character, an attacker\n        can trigger stack exhaustion or potentially cause stack memory corruption.\n\n        Although this vulnerability may lead to code execution, it has not been proven\n        to be possible at the time of this writing.\n\n        NOTE: In some circumstances, a '.' may be found before the top of the stack is\n        reached. In these cases, this module may not be able to cause a crash.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/dos/windows/llmnr/ms11_030_dnsapi","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/dos/windows/llmnr/ms11_030_dnsapi"},"author":["jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"name":"RHOSTS","required":true,"default":"224.0.0.252","description":"The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'"},{"name":"RPORT","required":true,"default":"5355","description":"The target port"},{"name":"CPORT","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client port"},{"name":"CHOST","required":false,"default":"","description":"The local client address"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60d3f71a-6eb6-5e2e-bb43-ae78560120cd"}}}
