Additionally, cookies are downloaded. Which\n        could potentially yield valid web sessions.\n\n        Firefox stores passwords within the signons.sqlite database file. There is also a\n        keys3.db file which contains the key for decrypting these passwords. In cases where\n        a Master Password has not been set, the passwords can easily be decrypted using\n        3rd party tools or by setting the DECRYPT option to true. Using the latter often\n        needs root privileges. Also be warned that if your session dies in the middle of the\n        file renaming process, this could leave Firefox in a non working state. If a\n        Master Password was used the only option would be to bruteforce.\n\n        Useful 3rd party tools:\n        + firefox_decrypt (https://github.com/Unode/firefox_decrypt)\n        + pswRecovery4Moz (https://github.com/philsmd/pswRecovery4Moz)","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/post/multi/gather/firefox_creds","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/post/multi/gather/firefox_creds","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/post/multi/gather/firefox_creds"},"author":["bannedit <bannedit@metasploit.com>","xard4s","g0tmi1k"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"advanced":false,"evasion":false,"name":"SESSION","required":true,"default":"","description":"The session to run this module on."},{"advanced":false,"evasion":false,"name":"DECRYPT","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Decrypts passwords without third party tools"},{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT","required":true,"default":"20","description":"Timeout to wait when downloading files through shell sessions"},{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"DISCLAIMER","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Acknowledge the DECRYPT warning"},{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"RECOVER","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Attempt to recover from bad DECRYPT when possible"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29862b2e-f4c6-541c-aa82-1be015dd0133"}}}
