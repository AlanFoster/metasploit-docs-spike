This could therefore be used to authenticate\n                         with a remote host using a private key which is loaded into a remote user's Pageant instance,\n                         without ever having knowledge of the private key itself.\n\n                         Note that this requires the PageantJacker meterpreter extension, but this will be automatically\n                         loaded into the remote meterpreter session by this module if it is not already loaded.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/post/windows/manage/forward_pageant","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/post/windows/manage/forward_pageant","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/post/windows/manage/forward_pageant"},"author":["Stuart Morgan <stuart.morgan@mwrinfosecurity.com>","Ben Campbell <eat_meatballs@hotmail.co.uk>"],"notes":{"SideEffects":null,"Reliability":null,"Stability":null},"options":[{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"WORKSPACE","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify the workspace for this module"},{"advanced":true,"evasion":false,"name":"VERBOSE","required":false,"default":"false","description":"Enable detailed status messages"},{"advanced":false,"evasion":false,"name":"SESSION","required":true,"default":"","description":"The session to run this module on."},{"advanced":false,"evasion":false,"name":"SocketPath","required":false,"default":"","description":"Specify a filename for the local UNIX socket."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27443c21-c3e8-595e-9b56-a4034d445bfb"}}}
