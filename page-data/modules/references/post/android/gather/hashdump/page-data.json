Root is required.\n           To perform this operation, two things are needed.  First, a password.key file\n           is required as this contains the hash but no salt.  Next, a sqlite3 database\n           is needed (with supporting files) to pull the salt from.  Combined, this\n           creates the hash we need.  Samsung based devices change the hash slightly.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/post/android/gather/hashdump","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/post/android/gather/hashdump","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/post/android/gather/hashdump"},"references":["https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/cracking-android-passwords-a-how-to/","https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-2202.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5ea2ecf0-6c32-560e-94a4-681c791471af"}}}
