Successful exploitation\n        will result in arbitrary code execution as LocalSystem. This exploit\n        only requires 1 UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast\n        address.\n\n        The ISS exception handler will recover the process after each overflow, giving\n        us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/firewall/blackice_pam_icq","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/firewall/blackice_pam_icq","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/firewall/blackice_pam_icq"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2004-0362/","OSVDB (4355)","http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Advisories/AD20040318.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5a58b50e-9da0-5612-aad0-86dea805b957"}}}
