This module is capable of bypassing\n        NX on some operating systems and service packs. The correct target must be\n        used to prevent the Server Service (along with a dozen others in the same\n        process) from crashing. Windows XP targets seem to handle multiple successful\n        exploitation events, but 2003 targets will often crash or hang on subsequent\n        attempts. This is just the first version of this module, full support for\n        NX bypass on 2003, along with other platforms, is still in development.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-4250/","OSVDB (49243)","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2008/MS08-067","http://www.rapid7.com/vulndb/lookup/dcerpc-ms-netapi-netpathcanonicalize-dos"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23db4636-0ef8-51bf-99cc-d21f9009604a"}}}
