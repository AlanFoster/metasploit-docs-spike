It may be possible to satisfy this condition by using\n        a custom DNS and LDAP setup, however that method is not covered here.\n\n        Although Windows XP SP2 is vulnerable, Microsoft reports that Administrator\n        credentials are required to reach the vulnerable code. Windows XP SP1 only\n        requires valid user credentials. Also, testing shows that a machine already\n        joined to a domain is not exploitable.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/smb/ms06_070_wkssvc","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/smb/ms06_070_wkssvc","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/smb/ms06_070_wkssvc"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-4691/","OSVDB (30263)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/20985","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2006/MS06-070"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1982a6f2-3617-52e7-9e63-4139af535c9b"}}}
