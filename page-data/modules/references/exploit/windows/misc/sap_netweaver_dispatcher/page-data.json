The overflow occurs in the DiagTraceR3Info() function and allows a remote\n        attacker to execute arbitrary code by supplying a special crafted Diag packet. The\n        Dispatcher service is only vulnerable if the Developer Traces have been configured\n        at levels 2 or 3. The module has been successfully tested on SAP Netweaver 7.0 EHP2\n        SP6 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2 (DEP bypass).","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher"},"references":["OSVDB (81759)","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-2611/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53424","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20705","http://www.coresecurity.com/content/sap-netweaver-dispatcher-multiple-vulnerabilities","http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&action=view&type=publication&name=Uncovering_SAP_vulnerabilities_reversing_and_breaking_the_Diag_protocol"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d9f6ad94-b4c5-575a-9835-b25e69ea28ba"}}}
