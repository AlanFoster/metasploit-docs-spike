When the user types the provided rundll32\n        command on a system, rundll32 will load the dll remotly and execute the provided export function.\n        The export function needs to be valid, but the default meterpreter function can be anything.\n        The process does write the dll to C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\LocalService\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TfsStore\\Tfs_DAV\n        but does not load the dll from that location. This file should be removed after execution.\n        The extension can be anything you'd like, but you don't have to use one. Two files will be\n        written to disk. One named the requested name and one with a dll extension attached.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/webdav_delivery","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/webdav_delivery","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/misc/webdav_delivery"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9526a608-1dab-5fae-8898-25247c2c124a"}}}
