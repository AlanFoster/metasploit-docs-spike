By supplying a long string of data as the file path with opcode '20',\n        a buffer overflow can occur when this data is being written on the stack where\n        no proper bounds checking is done beforehand, which results arbitrary code\n        execution under the context of SYSTEM.  This module is also made against systems\n        such as Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 that have DEP and/or ASLR\n        enabled by default.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/hp_omniinet_4","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/hp_omniinet_4","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/misc/hp_omniinet_4"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-1865/","OSVDB (73571)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17468","http://www.coresecurity.com/content/HP-Data-Protector-multiple-vulnerabilities","http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c02872182"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"58a0c26d-1d6a-5928-ad2f-f3350cbef1d1"}}}
