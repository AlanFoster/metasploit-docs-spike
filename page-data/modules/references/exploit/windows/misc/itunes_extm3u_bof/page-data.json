For example,\n        IE/Firefox/Opera by default will ask the user for permission before launching the\n        itms link by iTunes.  Chrome will ask for permission, but also spits a warning.\n        Safari would be an ideal target, because it will open the link without any\n        user interaction.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/misc/itunes_extm3u_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/misc/itunes_extm3u_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/misc/itunes_extm3u_bof"},"references":["OSVDB (83220)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19322","http://pastehtml.com/view/c25uhk4ab.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"43c8b29e-ae24-5165-aa23-15393a140f7a"}}}
