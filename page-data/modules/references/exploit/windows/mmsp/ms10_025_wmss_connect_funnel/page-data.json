Windows Media Services 4.1 ships\n        with Windows 2000 Server, but is not installed by default.\n\n        NOTE: This service does NOT restart automatically. Successful, as well as\n        unsuccessful exploitation attempts will kill the service which prevents\n        additional attempts.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0478/","OSVDB (63726)","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2010/MS10-025","https://www.lexsi.com/abonnes/labs/adviso-cve-2010-0478.txt"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"da2c4f4f-54b0-5394-b9db-2ee1bf01f717"}}}
