The vulnerable component allows to execute remote BCL files in\n        shared resources. An attacker can abuse this behavior to execute a malicious BCL and\n        drop an arbitrary EXE. The last one can be executed remotely through the WebView server.\n        This module has been tested successfully in GE Proficy CIMPLICITY 7.5 with the embedded\n        CimWebServer. This module starts a WebDAV server to provide the malicious BCL files. If\n        the target does not have the WebClient service enabled, an external SMB service is necessary.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/scada/ge_proficy_cimplicity_gefebt","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/scada/ge_proficy_cimplicity_gefebt","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/scada/ge_proficy_cimplicity_gefebt"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-0750/","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-14-015","http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-14-023-01"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38f19132-7e23-5ba5-971c-83ed62b6805a"}}}
