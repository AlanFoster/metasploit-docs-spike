Insufficient validation within\n         the uploadImageCommon function in the UploadAjaxAction script allows unauthenticated callers to\n         upload arbitrary code (instead of an image) to the server, which will then be executed under the\n         high-privilege context of the IIS AppPool.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-0854/","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-128","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-014-01"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a6edcd4-63db-5f16-a954-7dca164b0e76"}}}
