While processing a password, the application\n        fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack.\n        This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling\n        record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution.  Also, after the\n        payload exits, Coreservice.exe should automatically recover.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/scada/procyon_core_server","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/scada/procyon_core_server","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/scada/procyon_core_server"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-3322/","OSVDB (75371)","http://www.stratsec.net/Research/Advisories/Procyon-Core-Server-HMI-Remote-Stack-Overflow"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c0452c43-43a6-509e-9743-dfd2b1b158b1"}}}
