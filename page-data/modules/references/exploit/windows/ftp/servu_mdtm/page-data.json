It has been heavily tested against versions\n        4.0.0.4/4.1.0.0/4.1.0.3/5.0.0.0 with success against\n        nt4/2k/xp/2k3. I have also had success against version 3,\n        but only tested 1 version/os. The bug is in all versions\n        prior to 5.0.0.4, but this exploit will not work against\n        versions not listed above. You only get one shot, but it\n        should be OS/SP independent.\n\n        This exploit is a single hit, the service dies after the\n        shellcode finishes execution.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/servu_mdtm","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/servu_mdtm","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ftp/servu_mdtm"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2004-0330/","OSVDB (4073)","http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2004-02/0654.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/9751"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3c6e2b3f-f559-58ef-b6e7-911c1560beac"}}}
