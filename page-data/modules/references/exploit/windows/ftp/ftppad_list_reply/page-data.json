The overflow is\n        triggered when the client connects to a FTP server which sends an overly long directory\n        and filename in response to a LIST command.\n\n        This will cause an access violation, and will eventually overwrite the saved extended\n        instruction pointer.  Payload can be found at EDX+5c and ESI+5c, so a little pivot/\n        sniper was needed to make this one work.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/ftppad_list_reply","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/ftppad_list_reply","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ftp/ftppad_list_reply"},"references":["OSVDB (68714)","http://www.corelan.be:8800/index.php/2010/10/12/death-of-an-ftp-client/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"916199a3-39cc-5a28-be12-71911cd3984a"}}}
