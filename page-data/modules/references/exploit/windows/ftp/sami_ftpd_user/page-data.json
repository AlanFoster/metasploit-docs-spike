The stack is overwritten\n        when the administrator attempts to view the FTP logs. Therefore, this exploit\n        is passive and requires end-user interaction. Keep this in mind when selecting\n        payloads. When the server is restarted, it will re-execute the exploit until\n        the logfile is manually deleted via the file system.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-0441/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-2212/","OSVDB (25670)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16370","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22045","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17835","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1448","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1452","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1462","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/3127","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/3140"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a5f671ad-50f8-59dc-8305-c47449213b34"}}}
