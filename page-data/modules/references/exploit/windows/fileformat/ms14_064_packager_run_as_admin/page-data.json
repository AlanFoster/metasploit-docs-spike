However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows\n        platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. Please keep in mind that some other\n        setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and may end up with a\n        crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_064_packager_run_as_admin","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_064_packager_run_as_admin","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_064_packager_run_as_admin"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-6352/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2014/MS14-064","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/70690","http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/bypassing-microsofts-patch-sandworm-zero-day-even-editing-dangerous"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80fdf027-063f-5272-8e18-40490c42f8d8"}}}
