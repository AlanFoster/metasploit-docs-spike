However, if the victim machine is connected to a remote share\n        (or something similar), then it's also possible to execute arbitrary code.\n        Please note that a custom template is required for the payload, because the\n        default Metasploit template is detectable by McAfee -- any Windows binary, such\n        as calc.exe or notepad.exe, should bypass McAfee fine.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec"},"references":["OSVDB (78310)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/51397","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-012"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"fb72720d-ad70-5c64-80d2-a5e78bc73343"}}}
