When handling\n        a TeXML file, it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, and then\n        gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.  This is due to the\n        QuickTime3GPP.gtx component not handling certain Style subfields properly, storing\n        user-supplied data on the stack, which results the overflow.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_texml","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_texml","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_texml"},"references":["OSVDB (81934)","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-0663/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53571","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-107","http://0x1byte.blogspot.com/2012/06/cve-2012-0663-and-cve-2012-0664-samples.html","http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"958c5cab-6714-5c30-917b-92c50e19700b"}}}
