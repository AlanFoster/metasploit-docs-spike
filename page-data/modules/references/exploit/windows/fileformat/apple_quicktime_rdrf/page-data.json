The flaw is\n        triggered when QuickTime fails to properly handle the data length for certain\n        atoms such as 'rdrf' or 'dref' in the Alis record, which may result a buffer\n        overflow by loading a specially crafted .mov file, and allows arbitrary\n        code execution under the context of the current user. Please note: Since an egghunter\n        is used to search for the payload, this may require additional time for\n        the exploit to complete.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_rdrf","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_rdrf","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/apple_quicktime_rdrf"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-1017/","OSVDB (93625)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/60097","http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5770","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-110"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5ba675b9-5aa5-5c48-a7df-55c7bf447a8e"}}}
