The createDataObject() Javascript API function allows for writing\n          arbitrary files to the file system. This issue was fixed in version 4.3.1.0218.\n\n          Note: This exploit uses the All Users directory currently, which required\n          administrator privileges to write to. This means an administrative user has to\n          open the file to be successful. Kind of lame but thats how it goes sometimes in\n          the world of file write bugs.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_reader_filewrite","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_reader_filewrite","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/foxit_reader_filewrite"},"references":["OSVDB (71104)","http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/03/dangerous-file-write-bug-in-foxit-pdf.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8901854d-0629-554e-be05-5e01eb1a17cf"}}}
