The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to\n          represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a\n          dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a\n          chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer\n          of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format\n          supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned\n          by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used\n          in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the\n          memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the\n          context of the user.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-3906/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2013/MS13-096","OSVDB (99376)","http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2896666","http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/05/cve-2013-3906-a-graphics-vulnerability-exploited-through-word-documents.aspx"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"eac825a1-de65-52b0-b7c0-68454e7e90dd"}}}
