Adobe Reader and Acrobat\n        are also vulnerable, as are any other applications that may embed Flash player.\n\n        Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash\n        movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure\n        that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.\n\n        NOTE: This module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the\n        adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various\n        Windows versions due to a hardcoded syscall number.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_button","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_button","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flashplayer_button"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3654/","OSVDB (68932)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/44504","http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa10-05.html","http://blog.fortinet.com/fuzz-my-life-flash-player-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2010-3654/","http://feliam.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/flash-on-a-pdf-with-minipdf-py/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ba47b98c-7677-50f3-9a14-5a171fcb9bb3"}}}
