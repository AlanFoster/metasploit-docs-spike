In this case, we abuse the profiler by pointing to a payload DLL\n      that will be launched as the profiling thread.  This thread will run at the permission\n      level of the calling process, so an auto-elevating process will launch the DLL with\n      elevated permissions.  In this case, we use gpedit.msc as the auto-elevated CLR\n      process, but others would work, too.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler"},"references":["https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/11","https://offsec.provadys.com/UAC-bypass-dotnet.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f837ddb0-c3b9-5386-9835-e29fc7c4bbc2"}}}
