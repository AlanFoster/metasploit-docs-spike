It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n        flag turned off.\n\n        This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n        been invoked.\n\n        The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If\n        specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your\n        payload in a separate process.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr"},"references":["https://enigma0x3.net/2016/08/15/fileless-uac-bypass-using-eventvwr-exe-and-registry-hijacking/","https://github.com/enigma0x3/Misc-PowerShell-Stuff/blob/master/Invoke-EventVwrBypass.ps1"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"dfb4db13-cb03-5f30-825b-0be6a2b5e229"}}}
