This\n        issue affects Windows Vista, 7, 8, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and\n        RT. Note that spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key combination Win+Shift+#\n        does not work in Vista, so the attacker will have to check if the user is already\n        running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false.\n\n        Three exploit techniques are available with this module. The WEB technique will\n        execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location.  The FILE technique\n        will drop an executable to the file system, set it to medium integrity and execute\n        it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly\n        from the command line, but may take some time to complete.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/ms13_005_hwnd_broadcast","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/ms13_005_hwnd_broadcast","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/local/ms13_005_hwnd_broadcast"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0008/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2013/MS13-005","OSVDB (88966)","http://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2013/02/a-few-years-ago-while-working-on.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d79d8a95-4bb3-50f2-89d5-c14449d9e1ec"}}}
