It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n          flag turned off.\n\n          This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n          been invoked.\n\n          The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If\n          specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your\n          payload in a separate process.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper"},"references":["https://winscripting.blog/2017/05/12/first-entry-welcome-and-uac-bypass/","https://github.com/winscripting/UAC-bypass/blob/master/FodhelperBypass.ps1","https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gootkit-malware-bypasses-windows-defender-by-setting-path-exclusions/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"816be1db-7743-5e47-969f-fa5ce4f99719"}}}
