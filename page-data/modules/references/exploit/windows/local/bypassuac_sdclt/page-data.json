It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n        flag turned off.\n\n        This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n        been invoked.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_sdclt","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_sdclt","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_sdclt"},"references":["https://enigma0x3.net/2017/03/17/fileless-uac-bypass-using-sdclt-exe/","https://github.com/enigma0x3/Misc-PowerShell-Stuff/blob/master/Invoke-SDCLTBypass.ps1","https://blog.sevagas.com/?Yet-another-sdclt-UAC-bypass"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6831088b-d7d9-5420-b15f-ddc1a79a47a4"}}}
