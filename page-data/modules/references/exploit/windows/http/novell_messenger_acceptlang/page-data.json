This flaw is triggered by any HTTP\n        request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes.\n        To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first\n        pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the\n        large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current\n        encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-0992/","OSVDB (24617)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17503"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9ae48283-53b3-5f5a-bab2-30b1912b8cbd"}}}
