It was necessary to utilize a egghunter shellcode\n        which was alphanumeric encoded by muts in the original exploit.\n\n        If you plan on using exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to migrate to a different process\n        as soon as possible. Any connections get reset after a short period of time. This is probably some timeout\n        handling code that causes this.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-1697/","OSVDB (43992)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28569"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9324eb54-00f8-5a04-9396-ec26eaf984a9"}}}
