The vulnerability is due to\n        Microsoft Exchange Server not randomizing the keys on a\n        per-installation basis resulting in them using the same validationKey\n        and decryptionKey values. With knowledge of these values, an attacker\n        can craft a special ViewState to cause an OS command to be executed\n        by NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM using .NET deserialization.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/exchange_ecp_viewstate","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/exchange_ecp_viewstate","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/exchange_ecp_viewstate"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-0688/","https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/2/24/cve-2020-0688-remote-code-execution-on-microsoft-exchange-server-through-fixed-cryptographic-keys"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0ac30af7-97d6-589b-a44f-fe07be521ff1"}}}
