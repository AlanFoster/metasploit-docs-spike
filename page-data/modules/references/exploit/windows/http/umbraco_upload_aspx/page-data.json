SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path\n        traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible\n        /umbraco/ directory.\n\n        The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that\n        though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic\n        cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows\n        7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the \"IIS APPPOOL\\ASP.NET v4.0\" user must have\n        write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx"},"references":["OSVDB (83765)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19671","http://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2012/7/3/find-bugs-faster-with-a-webmatrix-local-reference-instance.html","http://umbraco.codeplex.com/workitem/18192"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"269aa2a9-96c5-5bea-aaf6-6f8394943173"}}}
