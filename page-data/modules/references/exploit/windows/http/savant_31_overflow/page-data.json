The service\n        supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt\n        generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default\n        configuration, you only have 10 chances.\n\n        Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the\n        \"ord\" payloads is recommended.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/savant_31_overflow","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/savant_31_overflow","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/savant_31_overflow"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2002-1120/","OSVDB (9829)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5686","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/787"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"586b5e90-81c9-5342-b60f-e5246720e55a"}}}
