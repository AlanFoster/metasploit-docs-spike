When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default),\n      a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe,\n      by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default),\n      the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based\n      overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified.\n      The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes.\n      Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait.\n\n      Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very\n      reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will\n      continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted\n      from the queue in C:\\MDaemon\\RawFiles\\*.raw.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/mdaemon_worldclient_form2raw","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/mdaemon_worldclient_form2raw","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/mdaemon_worldclient_form2raw"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2003-1200/","OSVDB (3255)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/9317"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"057c1ddb-085e-5340-a443-48f1f8e5f451"}}}
