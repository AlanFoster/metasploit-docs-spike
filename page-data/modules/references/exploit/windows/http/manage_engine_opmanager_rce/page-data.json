The account\n        has a default password of \"plugin\" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By\n        log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to\n        write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This\n        module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/http/manage_engine_opmanager_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/http/manage_engine_opmanager_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/http/manage_engine_opmanager_rce"},"references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38174","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-7765/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-7766/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Sep/66","https://support.zoho.com/portal/manageengine/helpcenter/articles/pgsql-submitquery-do-vulnerability"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"99aa90db-442e-5257-b476-a764ad3c5545"}}}
