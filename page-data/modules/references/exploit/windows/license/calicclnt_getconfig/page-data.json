This exploit will only work if your IP address can be\n        resolved from the target system point of view. This can be\n        accomplished on a local network by running the 'nmbd' service\n        that comes with Samba. If you are running this exploit from\n        Windows and do not filter udp port 137, this should not be a\n        problem (if the target is on the same network segment). Due to\n        the bugginess of the software, you are only allowed one connection\n        to the agent port before it starts ignoring you. If it wasn't for this\n        issue, it would be possible to repeatedly exploit this bug.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/license/calicclnt_getconfig","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/license/calicclnt_getconfig","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/license/calicclnt_getconfig"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2005-0581/","OSVDB (14389)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12705","http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=213"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3d656df7-dcdf-5519-bba1-e1085470e982"}}}
