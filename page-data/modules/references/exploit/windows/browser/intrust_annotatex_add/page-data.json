The ActiveX component loads into memory without\n        opting into ALSR so this module exploits the vulnerability against windows Vista and\n        Windows 7 targets. A large heap spray is required to fulfill the requirement that EAX\n        points to part of the ROP chain in a heap chunk and the calculated call will hit the\n        pivot in a separate heap chunk. This will take some time in the users browser.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/intrust_annotatex_add","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/intrust_annotatex_add","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/intrust_annotatex_add"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-5896/","OSVDB (80662)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/52765","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18674"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"870cd7c1-43b5-5e60-8cb4-a22d3d961888"}}}
