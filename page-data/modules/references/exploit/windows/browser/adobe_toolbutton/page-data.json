The vulnerability exists while handling the ToolButton object, where\n        the cEnable callback can be used to early free the object memory. Later use of the object\n        allows triggering the use after free condition. This module has been tested successfully\n        on Adobe Reader 11.0.2 and 10.0.4, with IE and Windows XP SP3, as exploited in the wild in\n        November, 2013. At the moment, this module doesn't support Adobe Reader 9 targets; in order\n        to exploit Adobe Reader 9 the fileformat version of the exploit can be used.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_toolbutton","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_toolbutton","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_toolbutton"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-3346/","OSVDB (96745)","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-212","http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb13-15.html","http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/11/ms-windows-local-privilege-escalation-zero-day-in-the-wild.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"77cb777a-dd27-54ac-b03f-2afee50eeb47"}}}
