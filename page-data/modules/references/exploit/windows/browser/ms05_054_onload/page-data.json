The javascript\n        prompt() places our shellcode near where the call operand points to.  We call\n        prompt() multiple times in separate iframes to place our return address.\n        We hide the prompts in a popup window behind the main window. We spray the heap\n        a second time with our shellcode and point the return address to the heap. I use\n        a fairly high address to make this exploit more reliable. IE will crash when the\n        exploit completes.  Also, please note that Internet Explorer must allow popups\n        in order to continue exploitation.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms05_054_onload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms05_054_onload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms05_054_onload"},"references":["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2005/MS05-054","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2005-1790/","OSVDB (17094)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/13799","http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2005-1790"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"dd102cbb-3b94-59a9-8e5d-dddb2fc37e7e"}}}
