The\n        vulnerability occurs when an invalid <object> tag exists and other elements\n        overlap/cover where the object tag should be when rendered (due to their\n        styles/positioning). The mshtml!CObjectElement is then freed from memory because\n        it is invalid. However, the mshtml!CDisplay object for the page continues to keep\n        a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading\n        to the use-after-free.\n\n          Please note that for IE 8 targets, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required\n        to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention).","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-1260/","OSVDB (72950)","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2011/MS11-050","http://d0cs4vage.blogspot.com/2011/06/insecticides-dont-kill-bugs-patch.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63ac1b0e-3142-5e61-9396-f925d9f377a5"}}}
