Due to the way IE handles objects in memory, it is\n        possible to cause a pointer in CTableRowCellsCollectionCacheItem::GetNext\n        to be used even after it gets freed, therefore allowing remote code\n        execution under the context of the user.\n\n          This particular vulnerability was also one of 2012's Pwn2Own\n        challenges, and was later explained by Peter Vreugdenhil with exploitation\n        details.  Instead of Peter's method, this module uses heap spraying like\n        the 99% to store a specially crafted memory layout before re-using the\n        freed memory.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_002_ie_object","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_002_ie_object","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_002_ie_object"},"references":["https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2010/MS10-002","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0248/","OSVDB (61914)","http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2012/03/15/pwn2own-2012-challenge-writeup","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-014"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0780ef7f-2a46-54dc-a1b5-714a38e8b593"}}}
