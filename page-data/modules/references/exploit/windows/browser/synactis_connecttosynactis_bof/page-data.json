When a long string of data is given\n        to the ConnectToSynactis function, which is meant to be used for the ldCmdLine\n        argument of a WinExec call, a strcpy routine can end up overwriting a TRegistry\n        class pointer saved on the stack, resulting in arbitrary code execution under the\n        context of the user.\n\n          Also note that since the WinExec function is used to call the default browser,\n        you must be aware that: 1) The default must be Internet Explorer, and 2) when the\n        exploit runs, another browser will pop up.\n\n          Synactis PDF In-The-Box is also used by other software such as Logic Print 2013,\n        which is how the vulnerability was found and publicly disclosed.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/synactis_connecttosynactis_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/synactis_connecttosynactis_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/synactis_connecttosynactis_bof"},"references":["OSVDB (93754)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25835"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ea9ef1e1-b490-5d36-bad0-f42134473771"}}}
