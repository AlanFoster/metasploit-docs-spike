Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also\n        vulnerable, as are any other applications that may embed Flash player.\n\n        Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash\n        movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure\n        that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled.\n\n        NOTE: This module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the\n        adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various\n        Windows versions due a hardcoded syscall number.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_newfunction"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-1297/","OSVDB (65141)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/40586","http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa10-01.html","http://feliam.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/flash-on-a-pdf-with-minipdf-py/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0ea0351d-46c9-5e82-8236-657ebaf2384b"}}}
