When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS\n        import, a C++ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary\n        code execution.\n\n        This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the\n        .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not\n        opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows\n        versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3971/","OSVDB (69796)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/45246","http://www.wooyun.org/bugs/wooyun-2010-0885","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Dec/110","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2011/MS11-003"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"eaaf4164-461c-5999-90ac-3000feca734d"}}}
