The\n        player is a browser plugin for IE (ActiveX) and Firefox (dll). When an\n        unsuspecting user visits a web page referring to a specially crafted\n        .dxstudio document, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n        Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for Firefox 2.0.0.20\n        and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE, the user will be prompted if they\n        wish to allow the plug-in to access local files. This prompt appears to\n        occur only once per server host.\n\n        NOTE: This exploit uses additionally dangerous script features to write\n        to local files!","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/dxstudio_player_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/dxstudio_player_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/dxstudio_player_exec"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-2011/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35273","OSVDB (54969)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/8922","http://dxstudio.com/guide.aspx"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c8fdf5e5-ed12-5ab3-8083-562bba3f002a"}}}
