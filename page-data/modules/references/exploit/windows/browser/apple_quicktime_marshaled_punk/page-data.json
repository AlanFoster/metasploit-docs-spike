When processing a specially-crafted HTML page, the QuickTime ActiveX\n        control will treat a supplied parameter as a trusted pointer. It will\n        then use it as a COM-type pUnknown and lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n        This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the\n        QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not\n        opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows\n        versions.\n\n        NOTE: The addresses may need to be adjusted for older versions of QuickTime.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/apple_quicktime_marshaled_punk","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/apple_quicktime_marshaled_punk","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/apple_quicktime_marshaled_punk"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-1818/","OSVDB (67705)","http://reversemode.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69&Itemid=1"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5e776458-1934-55d7-b1cb-316a648412ee"}}}
