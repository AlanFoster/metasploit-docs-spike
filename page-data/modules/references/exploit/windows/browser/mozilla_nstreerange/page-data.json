Sadly this exploit is still either dependent\n        on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free\n        modules anymore.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-0073/","OSVDB (72087)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/47663","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-157","https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630919","http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-13.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"908d033d-1123-5671-bd51-f051bedd2ff9"}}}
