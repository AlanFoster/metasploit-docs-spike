This is used to write and\n      execute shellcode in a WebAssembly object.\n        The shellcode is executed within the Chrome sandbox, so you must explicitly\n      disable the sandbox for the payload to be successful.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/chrome_filereader_uaf","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/chrome_filereader_uaf","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/chrome_filereader_uaf"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-5786/","https://github.com/exodusintel/CVE-2019-5786","https://blog.exodusintel.com/2019/03/20/cve-2019-5786-analysis-and-exploitation/","https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/analysis-of-a-chrome-zero-day-cve-2019-5786/","https://security.googleblog.com/2019/03/disclosing-vulnerabilities-to-protect.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f50f76af-e431-5349-933c-b667fc4f5a5a"}}}
