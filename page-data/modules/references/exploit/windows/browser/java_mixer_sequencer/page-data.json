When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM_Song\n        structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the\n        RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event\n        is used to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n        When triggering the vulnerability \"ebx\" points to a fake event in the MIDI file\n        which stores the shellcode. A \"jmp ebx\" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the\n        exploit reliable over java updates.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0842/","OSVDB (63493)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/39077","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-060","http://vreugdenhilresearch.nl/java-midi-parse-vulnerabilities/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a5fea73-cf21-5c52-bcbd-f3df8a54311c"}}}
