When the\n        user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use\n        a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server.\n\n        This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will\n        serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the\n        payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module\n        might use other methods that do not create such a warning.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0483/","OSVDB (62632)","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2010/MS10-022","https://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2010/02/28/investigating-a-new-win32hlp-and-internet-explorer-issue.aspx","https://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0027-msgbox-helpfile-ie.txt"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87a1dcfb-6045-56fd-a14a-c17a8595ca1a"}}}
