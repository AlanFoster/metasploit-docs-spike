MDAC versions affected include MDAC\n          1.5, 2.0, 2.0 SDK, 2.1 and systems with the MDAC Sample Pages for RDS\n          installed, and NT4 Servers with the NT Option Pack installed or upgraded\n          2000 systems often running IIS3/4/5 however some vulnerable installations\n          can still be found on newer Windows operating systems. Note that newer\n          releases of msadcs.dll can still be abused however by default remote\n          connections to the RDS is denied. Consider using VERBOSE if you're unable\n          to successfully execute a command, as the error messages are detailed\n          and useful for debugging. Also set NAME to obtain the remote hostname,\n          and METHOD to use the alternative VbBusObj technique.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/iis/msadc","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/iis/msadc","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/iis/msadc"},"references":["OSVDB (272)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/529","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-1999-1011/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/1998/MS98-004","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/1999/MS99-025"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"30fe2aaa-1554-524d-b360-4eb283c4e254"}}}
