If you've set EXITFUNC to 'seh', the\n        server will continue processing requests, but you will have\n        trouble terminating a bind shell. If you set EXITFUNC to\n        thread, the server will crash upon exit of the bind shell.\n        The payload is alpha-numerically encoded without a NOP sled\n        because otherwise the data gets mangled by the filters.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/iis/ms02_018_htr","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/iis/ms02_018_htr","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/iis/ms02_018_htr"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-1999-0874/","OSVDB (3325)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/307","http://www.eeye.com/html/research/advisories/AD19990608.html","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2002/MS02-018"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36301431-938b-543c-832f-feb1fd83a2c0"}}}
