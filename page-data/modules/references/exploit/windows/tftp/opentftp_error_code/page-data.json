The vulnerable\n        condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet, the TFTP\n        service will then format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes an\n        overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.\n\n          The offset (to EIP) is specific to how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone',\n        or 'Service').  By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default\n        configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/tftp/opentftp_error_code","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/tftp/opentftp_error_code","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/tftp/opentftp_error_code"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-2161/","OSVDB (44904)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/29111","http://downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/29111.pl"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"bf72487b-7304-5fec-bcf8-ead0d233b5d9"}}}
