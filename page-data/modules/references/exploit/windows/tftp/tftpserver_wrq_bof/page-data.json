The flaw\n        is due to the way TFTP handles the filename parameter extracted from a WRQ request.\n        The server will append the user-supplied filename to TFTP server binary's path\n        without any bounds checking, and then attempt to check this path with a fopen().\n        Since this isn't a valid file path, fopen() returns null, which allows the\n        corrupted data to be used in a strcmp() function, causing an access violation.\n\n        Since the offset is sensitive to how the TFTP server is launched, you must know\n        in advance if your victim machine launched the TFTP as a 'Service' or 'Standalone'\n        , and then manually select your target accordingly. A successful attempt will lead\n        to remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM if run as a service, or\n        the user if run as a standalone. A failed attempt will result a denial-of-service.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-1611/","OSVDB (43785)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18345","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5314"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98c6cb0f-8185-5992-89b7-c34d029389c2"}}}
