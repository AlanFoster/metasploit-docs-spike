As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default,\n        all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so\n        that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler"},"references":["http://www.slideshare.net/nullbind/sql-server-exploitation-escalation-pilfering-appsec-usa-2012","http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188279.aspx","http://www.exploit-monday.com/2011_10_16_archive.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6536f7be-1c74-58ec-b064-f82b0fc4086d"}}}
