Currently, three delivery methods are supported.\n\n        First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are\n        avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at\n        Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems.\n\n        A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using\n        various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default\n        the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target.\n\n        Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the\n        payload on the target.\n\n        NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the\n        attack is finished.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_payload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_payload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_payload"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2000-0402/","OSVDB (557)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1281","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2000-1209/","OSVDB (15757)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4797"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"290f85d5-f041-5076-9c30-85324c29eb39"}}}
