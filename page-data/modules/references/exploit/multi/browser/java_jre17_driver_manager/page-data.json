The vulnerability\n        affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play on Internet Explorer\n        and throws a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applicable mainly to IE, where Java\n        Web Start can be launched automatically through the ActiveX control. Otherwise, the\n        applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/browser/java_jre17_driver_manager","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/browser/java_jre17_driver_manager","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/browser/java_jre17_driver_manager"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-1488/","OSVDB (91472)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58504","http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/java-pwn2own/","http://immunityproducts.blogspot.com/2013/04/yet-another-java-security-warning-bypass.html","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-076"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"880fc995-cf65-5b97-bf6b-cbb568a83e3a"}}}
