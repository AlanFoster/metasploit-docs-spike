No memory corruption is used.\n\n        First, a Flash object is cloned into the anonymous content of the SVG\n        \"use\" element in the <body> (CVE-2013-0758). From there, the Flash object\n        can navigate a child frame to a URL in the chrome:// scheme.\n\n        Then a separate exploit (CVE-2013-0757) is used to bypass the security wrapper\n        around the child frame's window reference and inject code into the chrome://\n        context. Once we have injection into the chrome execution context, we can write\n        the payload to disk, chmod it (if posix), and then execute.\n\n        Note: Flash is used here to trigger the exploit but any Firefox plugin\n        with script access should be able to trigger it.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0758/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0757/","OSVDB (89019)","OSVDB (89020)","http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-15.html","https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=813906"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29ea8543-9998-5e58-b742-9087b6ef8c98"}}}
