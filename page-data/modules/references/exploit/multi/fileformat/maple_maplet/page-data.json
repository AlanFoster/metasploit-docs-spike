All versions up to 13 are suspected\n        vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 13 on Windows. Standard security\n        settings prevent code from running in a normal maple worksheet without user\n        interaction, but those setting do not prevent code in a Maplet from running.\n\n        In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to\n        open a specially modified .maplet file with Maple. By doing so, an attacker can\n        execute arbitrary code as the victim user.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/fileformat/maple_maplet","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/fileformat/maple_maplet","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/fileformat/maple_maplet"},"references":["OSVDB (64541)","http://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35f21442-b449-5401-b1ea-3a452c092eff"}}}
