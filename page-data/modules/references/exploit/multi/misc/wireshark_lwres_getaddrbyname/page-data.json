This bug found and reported by babi.\n\n        This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several\n        other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n        The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents\n        exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows\n        exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get\n        fragmented, which may cause additional complications.\n\n        NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered.\n        If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to\n        exploit this issue.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0304/","OSVDB (61987)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37985","http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2010-02.html","http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc/trunk-1.2/epan/dissectors/packet-lwres.c?view=diff&r1=31596&r2=28492&diff_format=h"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7e95024c-e809-5448-bc7f-a78195197fcb"}}}
