After authentication, a specially crafted tcp packet (default port 655)\n        leads to a buffer overflow and allows to execute arbitrary code. This module has\n        been tested with tinc-1.1pre6 on Windows XP (custom calc payload) and Windows 7\n        (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp), and tinc version 1.0.19 from the ports of\n        FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE # 0 and various other OS, see targets. The exploit probably works\n        for all versions <= 1.1pre6.\n        A manually compiled version (1.1.pre6) on Ubuntu 12.10 with gcc 4.7.2 seems to\n        be a non-exploitable crash due to calls to __memcpy_chk depending on how tincd\n        was compiled. Bug got fixed in version 1.0.21/1.1pre7. While writing this module\n        it was recommended to the maintainer to start using DEP/ASLR and other protection\n        mechanisms.","rank":200,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/vpn/tincd_bof","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/vpn/tincd_bof","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/vpn/tincd_bof"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-1428/","OSVDB (92653)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/59369","http://www.floyd.ch/?p=741","http://sitsec.net/blog/2013/04/22/stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-the-vpn-software-tinc-for-authenticated-peers/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6bdf0df1-4a50-56dd-bbbd-bedccdd45f14"}}}
