This module\n        writes a payload to the web root of the webserver before then executing\n        it with an HTTP request. The user running PHPMailer must have write\n        access to the specified WEB_ROOT directory and successful exploitation\n        can take a few minutes.","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-10033/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-10045/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40968","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40969","https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033","https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4aeb6737-b9ae-5269-b28e-78d0a45873a2"}}}
