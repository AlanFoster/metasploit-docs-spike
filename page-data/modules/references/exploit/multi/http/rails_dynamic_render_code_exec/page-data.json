This module doesnt use the log inclusion method of\n        exploitation due to it not being universal enough. Instead, a new code injection\n        technique was found and used whereby an attacker can upload temporary image files\n        against any POST endpoint and use them for the inclusion attack. Finally, you only\n        get one shot at this if you are testing with the builtin rails server, use caution.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/rails_dynamic_render_code_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/rails_dynamic_render_code_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/rails_dynamic_render_code_exec"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-0752/","https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/335P1DcLG00","https://nvisium.com/blog/2016/01/26/rails-dynamic-render-to-rce-cve-2016-0752/","https://gist.github.com/forced-request/5158759a6418e6376afb"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90ee2887-7c18-5202-abf6-94cd4f695ff1"}}}
