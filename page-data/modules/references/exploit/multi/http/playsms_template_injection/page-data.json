This issue is caused by double processing a server-side template with a custom\n          PHP template system called 'TPL' which is used in the PlaySMS template engine at\n          `src/Playsms/Tpl.php:_compile()`. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplied username with a\n          malicious payload is submitted. This malicious payload is then stored in a TPL template which when rendered a\n          second time, results in code execution.\n          The TPL(https://github.com/antonraharja/tpl) template language is vulnerable to PHP code injection.\n\n          This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on HackTheBox's Forlic Machine.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/playsms_template_injection","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/playsms_template_injection","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/playsms_template_injection"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-8644/","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu-bwoAtTrc","https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/11/technical-advisory-playsms-pre-authentication-remote-code-execution-cve-2020-8644/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e18dede1-5a83-5176-bdac-21817213ba17"}}}
