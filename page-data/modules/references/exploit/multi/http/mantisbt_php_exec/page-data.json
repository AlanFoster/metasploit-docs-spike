The import page is not checking the correct user level\n        of the user, so it's possible to exploit this issue with any user including the anonymous one if enabled.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-7146/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-8598/","https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17725","https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17780"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c4e90013-ee2c-51fc-9eb8-2710ea141270"}}}
