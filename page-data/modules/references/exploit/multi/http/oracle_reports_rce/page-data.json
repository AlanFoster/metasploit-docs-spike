The showenv url can be used to disclose information about a server. A second\n      vulnerability that allows arbitrary reading and writing to the host filesystem can then be\n      used to write a shell from a remote url to a known local path disclosed from the previous\n      vulnerability.\n\n      The local path being accessible from an URL allows an attacker to perform the remote code\n      execution using, for example, a .jsp shell.\n\n      This module was tested successfully on Windows and Oracle Forms and Reports 10.1.","rank":500,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/oracle_reports_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/oracle_reports_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/oracle_reports_rce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-3152/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-3153/","OSVDB (86395)","OSVDB (86394)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31253"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f237ca6d-eb9c-5c20-ad76-5b10d0642f00"}}}
