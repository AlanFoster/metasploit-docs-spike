The vulnerability exists\n        in the 'mappy' search command which allows attackers to run Python code.\n        To exploit this vulnerability, a valid Splunk user with the admin\n        role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of \"admin:changeme\",\n        the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface\n        runs as SYSTEM on Windows and as root on Linux by default.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/splunk_mappy_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/splunk_mappy_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/splunk_mappy_exec"},"references":["OSVDB (77695)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/51061","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-4642/","http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGMM","http://www.sec-1.com/blog/?p=233"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c687068-af2d-5c9a-a26a-821f26143910"}}}
