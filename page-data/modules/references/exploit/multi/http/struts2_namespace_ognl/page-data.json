Remote Code Execution can be performed\n        via an endpoint that makes use of a redirect action.\n\n        Note that this exploit is dependant on the version of Tomcat running on\n        the target.  Versions of Tomcat starting with 7.0.88 currently don't\n        support payloads larger than ~7.5kb.  Windows Meterpreter sessions on\n        Tomcat >=7.0.88 are currently not supported.\n\n        Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the\n        server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't\n        have to write to the disk.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/struts2_namespace_ognl","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/struts2_namespace_ognl","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/struts2_namespace_ognl"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-11776/","https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2018-11776","https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-057","https://github.com/hook-s3c/CVE-2018-11776-Python-PoC"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4e1e8a32-d5c4-5637-8650-628d2b69a578"}}}
