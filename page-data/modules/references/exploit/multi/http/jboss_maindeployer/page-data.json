To accomplish this, a\n        temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our\n        payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound\n        connections to us.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/jboss_maindeployer","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/jboss_maindeployer","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/jboss_maindeployer"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2007-1036/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0738/","OSVDB (33744)","http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/publications/jboss","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=574105"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42eb93a0-53c4-581d-9286-e7d75bf15f8b"}}}
