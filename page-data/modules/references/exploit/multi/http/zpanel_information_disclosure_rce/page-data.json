The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version\n        of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read\n        arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module\n        utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password\n        combination of the MySQL instance. With the\n        credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute\n        SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and\n        call it leading to remote code execution.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce"},"references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31173","OSVDB (102595)","http://blog.0xlabs.com/2014/03/zpanel-10.1.x-remote-root.html","http://pastebin.com/y5Pf4Yms"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f828c1da-ed8b-520f-ad4e-830eea1133c2"}}}
