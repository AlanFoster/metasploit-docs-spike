The user can choose specific tables to exclude from the backup\n        by setting the `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter in a POST request to the\n        `wp-database-backup` page. The names of the excluded tables are included in\n        the `mysqldump` command unsanitized. Arbitrary commands injected through the\n        `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter are executed each time the functionality\n        for creating a new database backup are run.\n\n        Authentication is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/wp_db_backup_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/wp_db_backup_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/wp_db_backup_rce"},"references":["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/05/os-command-injection-vulnerability-patched-in-wp-database-backup-plugin/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b4bf8a34-a4fe-5e1f-995c-9783a407fa40"}}}
