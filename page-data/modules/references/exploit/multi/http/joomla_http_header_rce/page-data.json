The custom created payload is then executed once the session is read\n          from the database. You also need to have a PHP version before 5.4.45 (including 5.3.x), 5.5.29 or 5.6.13.\n          In later versions the deserialisation of invalid session data stops on the first error and the\n          exploit will not work.
