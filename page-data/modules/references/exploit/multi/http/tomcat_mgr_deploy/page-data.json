The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive\n        containing a jsp application using a PUT request.\n\n        The manager application can also be abused using /manager/html/upload, but that\n        method is not implemented in this module.\n\n        NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For\n        example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-3843/","OSVDB (60317)","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-4189/","OSVDB (60670)","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-4188/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/38084","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0557/","http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419179","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-4094/","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-214","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-3548/","OSVDB (60176)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36954","http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/manager-howto.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5aa08c85-9de6-553b-9891-ee7c37a19a40"}}}
