The password reset will render the authentication useless.\n          Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this\n          module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login\n          and to perform the command injection. This module has been tested on version 2.6.1062r1\n          of the appliance.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/multi/http/trendmicro_threat_discovery_admin_sys_time_cmdi","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/multi/http/trendmicro_threat_discovery_admin_sys_time_cmdi","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/multi/http/trendmicro_threat_discovery_admin_sys_time_cmdi"},"references":["https://asciinema.org/a/112480","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-7552/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-7547/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7aba9488-d398-56f5-ba1f-2a4504069600"}}}
