The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that\n          allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser\n          renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious\n          website.\n          The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer\n          to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite\n          the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part\n          of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading\n          and writing of kernel memory.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/android/local/binder_uaf","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/android/local/binder_uaf","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/android/local/binder_uaf"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-2215/","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942","https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html","https://hernan.de/blog/2019/10/15/tailoring-cve-2019-2215-to-achieve-root/","https://github.com/grant-h/qu1ckr00t/blob/master/native/poc.c"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5276a465-0a0e-581d-85bd-4f91575c7947"}}}
