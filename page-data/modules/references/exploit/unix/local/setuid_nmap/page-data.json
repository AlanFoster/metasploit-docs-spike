Nevertheless, administrators sometimes feel the need\n          to do insecure things.  This module abuses a setuid nmap binary by\n          writing out a lua nse script containing a call to os.execute().\n\n          Note that modern interpreters will refuse to run scripts on the\n          command line when EUID != UID, so the cmd/unix/reverse_{perl,ruby}\n          payloads will most likely not work.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/local/setuid_nmap","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/local/setuid_nmap","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/local/setuid_nmap"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9cbbb5b7-49b8-5ebc-ba29-3487c21262ae"}}}
