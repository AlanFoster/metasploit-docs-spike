A new blocklist is added, and then an\n          update is forced (gravity) to pull in the blocklist content.  PHP content is then written\n          to a file within the webroot.  Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter,\n          effectively running a priv esc.  Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php, overwriting,\n          the content.  Lastly, the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root, which launches\n          our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/http/pihole_blocklist_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/http/pihole_blocklist_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/http/pihole_blocklist_exec"},"references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48443","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48442","https://frichetten.com/blog/cve-2020-11108-pihole-rce/","https://github.com/frichetten/CVE-2020-11108-PoC","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-11108/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c966018f-a103-5806-af73-71388a153e5a"}}}
