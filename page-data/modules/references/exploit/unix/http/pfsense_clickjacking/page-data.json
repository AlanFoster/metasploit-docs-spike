It was found that the\n          pfSense WebGUI is vulnerable to Clickjacking. By tricking an authenticated admin\n          into interacting with a specially crafted webpage it is possible for an attacker\n          to execute arbitrary code in the WebGUI. Since the WebGUI runs as the root user,\n          this will result in a full compromise of the pfSense instance.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/http/pfsense_clickjacking","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/http/pfsense_clickjacking","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/http/pfsense_clickjacking"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-1000479/","https://securify.nl/en/advisory/SFY20171101/clickjacking-vulnerability-in-csrf-error-page-pfsense.html","https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/2.4.2_New_Features_and_Changes"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72b1bbb2-0d70-5a0c-9991-7172334bce58"}}}
