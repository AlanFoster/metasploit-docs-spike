The exploit uses the Upload Theme\n          functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the\n          admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing\n          a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7,\n          but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration,\n          a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin\n          uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to\n          something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses\n          the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers\n          applied the fixes to all previous versions too.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload"},"references":["http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/remote-file-upload-vulnerability-on-mailpoet-wysija-newsletters.html","http://www.mailpoet.com/security-update-part-2/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/943427/wysija-newsletters/trunk/helpers/back.php","https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/6680"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90ea4f1a-3178-5214-9607-8ad5d547e713"}}}
