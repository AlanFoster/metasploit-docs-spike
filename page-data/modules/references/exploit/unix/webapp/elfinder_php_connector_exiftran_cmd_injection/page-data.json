The file name of uploaded files is not validated,\n        allowing shell metacharacters.\n\n        When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passed\n        to the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causing\n        shell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remote\n        command injection as the web server user.\n\n        The PHP connector is not enabled by default.\n\n        The system must have `exiftran` installed and in `$PATH`.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on elFinder versions 2.1.47,\n        2.1.20 and 2.1.16 on Ubuntu.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-9194/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46481","https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/releases/tag/2.1.48","https://www.secsignal.org/news/cve-2019-9194-triggering-and-exploiting-a-1-day-vulnerability/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"febfd8a1-a875-50d0-834f-42c91e38b3e2"}}}
