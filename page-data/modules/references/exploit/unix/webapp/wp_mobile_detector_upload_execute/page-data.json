This flaw exists because the\n          /wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/resize.php script does contains a\n          remote file include for files not cached by the system already.\n          By uploading a .php file, the remote system will\n          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the\n          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges\n          of the web server.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_mobile_detector_upload_execute","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_mobile_detector_upload_execute","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_mobile_detector_upload_execute"},"references":["https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8505","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39891","https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2016/05/31/aribitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wp-mobile-detector/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3104d0dd-1be1-5c0a-bcd6-13cf220ad1a0"}}}
