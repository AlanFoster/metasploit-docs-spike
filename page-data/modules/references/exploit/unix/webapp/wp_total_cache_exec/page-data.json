WP Super Cache 1.2 or older\n        is also reported as vulnerable.  The vulnerability is due to the handling of certain\n        macros such as mfunc, which allows arbitrary PHP code injection.  A valid post ID is\n        needed in order to add the malicious comment.  If the POSTID option isn't specified,\n        then the module will automatically find or bruteforce one.  Also, if anonymous comments\n        aren't allowed, then a valid username and password must be provided.  In addition,\n        the \"A comment is held for moderation\" option on WordPress must be unchecked for\n        successful exploitation.  This module has been tested against WordPress 3.5 and\n        W3 Total Cache 0.9.2.3 on a Ubuntu 10.04 system.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_total_cache_exec","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_total_cache_exec","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_total_cache_exec"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-2010/","OSVDB (92652)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/59316","http://wordpress.org/support/topic/pwn3d","http://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/wp-plugins-remote-code-execution/","https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/6622"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"de29d29f-f853-57a5-b42f-9e96036f4b74"}}}
