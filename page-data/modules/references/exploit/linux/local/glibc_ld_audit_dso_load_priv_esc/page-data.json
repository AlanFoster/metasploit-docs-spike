This allows loading arbitrary shared objects from\n        the trusted library search path with the privileges of the suid user.\n\n        This module uses LD_AUDIT to load the libpcprofile.so shared object,\n        distributed with some versions of glibc, and leverages arbitrary file\n        creation functionality in the library constructor to write a root-owned\n        world-writable file to a system trusted search path (usually /lib).\n        The file is then overwritten with a shared object then loaded with\n        LD_AUDIT resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.11.1 on\n        Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and version 2.7 on Debian 5.0.4 i386.\n\n        RHEL 5 is reportedly affected, but untested. Some glibc distributions\n        do not contain the libpcprofile.so library required for successful\n        exploitation.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3847/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3856/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/44154","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/44347","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15274","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15304","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18105","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/257","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344","https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1009-1","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3847","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3856","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3856"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"969c47a7-fb0b-597f-8d31-1c716c95eb2c"}}}
