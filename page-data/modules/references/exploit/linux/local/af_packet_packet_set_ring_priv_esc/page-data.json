Failed exploitation\n        may crash the kernel.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 18 (x86_64)\n        with kernel versions:\n\n        4.8.0-34-generic;\n        4.8.0-36-generic;\n        4.8.0-39-generic;\n        4.8.0-41-generic;\n        4.8.0-42-generic;\n        4.8.0-44-generic;\n        4.8.0-45-generic.","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/local/af_packet_packet_set_ring_priv_esc","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/local/af_packet_packet_set_ring_priv_esc","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/local/af_packet_packet_set_ring_priv_esc"},"references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41994","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7308/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97234","https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html","https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/solving-post-exploitation-issue-cve-2017-7308","https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2017/CVE-2017-7308.html","https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits/blob/master/CVE-2017-7308/poc.c","https://github.com/bcoles/kernel-exploits/blob/cve-2017-7308/CVE-2017-7308/poc.c"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e24758b0-877e-5afd-865d-daffac5d838a"}}}
