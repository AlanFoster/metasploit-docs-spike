This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but\n          not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of\n          a user with an active Polkit agent.\n          In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles\n          the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace\n          relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging\n          certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops\n          privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One\n          contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic).\n          Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as\n          privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper\n          with PTRACE_TRACEME.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-13272/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47133","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153663","https://github.com/bcoles/kernel-exploits/tree/master/CVE-2019-13272","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1903"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c805a04-bbfa-59f7-9111-2e031e987a72"}}}
