SQLi on /commands.inc.php allows us to add an administrative user.\n          2. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user\n          3. Command Injection on /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php allows us to\n             execute the payload.\n          4. Remove the added admin user.\n        Tips : once you get a shell, look at the CVE-2019-19585.\n        You will probably get root because rConfig install script add Apache user to\n        sudoers with nopasswd ;-)","rank":400,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/rconfig_ajaxarchivefiles_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/rconfig_ajaxarchivefiles_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/rconfig_ajaxarchivefiles_rce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-19509/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-10220/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47982","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48208","https://github.com/v1k1ngfr/exploits-rconfig/blob/master/rconfig_CVE-2019-19509.py","https://github.com/v1k1ngfr/exploits-rconfig/blob/master/rconfig_CVE-2020-10220.py"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"992e17f1-6937-55da-bfa9-26d82f54ba5d"}}}
