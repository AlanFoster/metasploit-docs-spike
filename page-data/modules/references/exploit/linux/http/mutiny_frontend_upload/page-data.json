The\n        EditDocument servlet provides a file upload function to authenticated users. A\n        directory traversal vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary\n        file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges. In\n        order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role) in the web frontend is\n        required. The module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/mutiny_frontend_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/mutiny_frontend_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/mutiny_frontend_upload"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0136/","OSVDB (93444)","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/701572","https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/05/15/new-1day-exploits-mutiny-vulnerabilities"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3dc5705b-d64c-5469-826a-1ed3b11c8a10"}}}
