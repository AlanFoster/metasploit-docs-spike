However, the command\n          with drive is limited to 30 characters.  A somewhat valid drive name is required,\n          thus /dev/sd is used, even though it doesn't exist.  To circumvent the character\n          restriction, a wget input file is staged in /a, and executed to download our payload\n          to /b.  From there the payload is executed.  A wfsdelay is required to give time\n          for the payload to download, and the execution of it to run.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/synology_dsm_smart_exec_auth","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/synology_dsm_smart_exec_auth","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/synology_dsm_smart_exec_auth"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-15889/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43190","https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-synology-storagemanager-smart-cgi-remote-command-execution/","https://synology.com/en-global/security/advisory/Synology_SA_17_65_DSM"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3b4d3414-716a-5465-9c39-6a332bed8887"}}}
