The second problem is due to the\n        use of unsafe deserialization, which allows the malicious Ruby object to be loaded,\n        and results in arbitrary remote code execution.\n\n        This exploit was tested against version 2.8.0.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/github_enterprise_secret","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/github_enterprise_secret","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/github_enterprise_secret"},"references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41616","http://exablue.de/blog/2017-03-15-github-enterprise-remote-code-execution.html","https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.8.7/notes"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4eb34044-f431-565a-8ad0-04f0f52723d0"}}}
