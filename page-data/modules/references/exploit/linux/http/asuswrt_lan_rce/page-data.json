This can be combined with another vulnerability in\n      the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly\n      from the POST request to enable a special command mode.\n      This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running\n      on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root.\n      This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it.\n      It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce"},"references":["https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3589","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/asuswrt-lan-rce.txt","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jan/78","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-5999/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-6000/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2d3645fc-31f7-5613-a8cb-3030020fdd4f"}}}
