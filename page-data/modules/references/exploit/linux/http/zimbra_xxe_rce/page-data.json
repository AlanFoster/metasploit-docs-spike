The XML external entity vulnerability\n        in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration\n        file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The\n        zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie\n        with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request\n        forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with\n        the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin\n        cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is\n        used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web\n        server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly\n        affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11.\n\n        This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64\n        UBUNTU16_64 FOSS edition.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-9670/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-9621/","https://blog.tint0.com/2019/03/a-saga-of-code-executions-on-zimbra.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b4c5f36e-1902-5ff3-abc6-9afe3678a19e"}}}
