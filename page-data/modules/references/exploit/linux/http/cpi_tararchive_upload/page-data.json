The issue is that\n        the TarArchive Java class the HA Health Monitor component uses does not check for any\n        directory traversals while unpacking a Tar file, which can be abused by a remote user to\n        leverage the UploadServlet class to upload a JSP payload to the Apache Tomcat's web apps\n        directory, and gain arbitrary remote code execution. Note that authentication is not\n        required to exploit this vulnerability.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/cpi_tararchive_upload","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/cpi_tararchive_upload","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/cpi_tararchive_upload"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-1821/","https://srcincite.io/blog/2019/05/17/panic-at-the-cisco-unauthenticated-rce-in-prime-infrastructure.html","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-rce","https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2019-0034/","https://srcincite.io/pocs/src-2019-0034.py.txt"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"bfd34c66-bdc3-5837-a9da-5d70f0e76277"}}}
