As the docker container\n        executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system\n        allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit\n        abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the\n        host server.\n\n        The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image\n        from hub.docker.com.\n\n        Use `check` with verbose mode to get a list of exploitable Rancher\n        Hosts managed by the target system.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/rancher_server","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/rancher_server","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/rancher_server"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d03468d8-93cd-5071-ae58-5fb9143d1706"}}}
