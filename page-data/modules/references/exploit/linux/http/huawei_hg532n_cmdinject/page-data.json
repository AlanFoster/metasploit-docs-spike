The limited mode is used\n        here to expose the router's telnet port to the outside world through NAT\n        port-forwarding.\n\n        With telnet now remotely accessible, the router's limited \"ATP command\n        line tool\" (served over telnet) can be upgraded to a root shell through\n        an injection into the ATP's hidden \"ping\" command.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/huawei_hg532n_cmdinject","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/huawei_hg532n_cmdinject","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/huawei_hg532n_cmdinject"},"references":["https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/8245"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"af05c5ec-aa15-5fff-a7b9-08e7aa629204"}}}
