The first flaw is a file\n        upload vulnerability that allows the attacker to upload and execute files as the Apache\n        Tomcat user; the second is a privilege escalation to root by bypassing execution restrictions\n        in a SUID binary.\n\n        This module exploits these vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution\n        as root on the CPI default installation.\n\n        This module has been tested with CPI 3.2.0.0.258 and 3.4.0.0.348. Earlier and later versions\n        might also be affected, although 3.4.0.0.348 is the latest at the time of writing.\n        The file upload vulnerability should have been fixed in versions 3.4.1 and 3.3.1 Update 02.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/cisco_prime_inf_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/cisco_prime_inf_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/cisco_prime_inf_rce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-15379/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Oct/19","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/cisco-prime-infrastructure.txt","https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3723","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-pi-tftp"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f7a1196a-d9a3-5829-ba60-626f114068c9"}}}
