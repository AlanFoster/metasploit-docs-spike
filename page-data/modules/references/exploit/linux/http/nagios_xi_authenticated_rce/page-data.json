For all supported targets except Linux\n        (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the\n        target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is\n        running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target\n        must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the\n        malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported.\n\n        Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are\n        required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.6.5\n        running on CentOS 7. The module may behave differently against older\n        versions of Nagios XI. See the documentation for more information.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/nagios_xi_authenticated_rce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/nagios_xi_authenticated_rce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/nagios_xi_authenticated_rce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-15949/","https://github.com/jakgibb/nagiosxi-root-rce-exploit"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21618698-feed-5135-be92-f3c62a12670c"}}}
