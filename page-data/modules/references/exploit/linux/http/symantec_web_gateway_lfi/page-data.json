By injecting PHP code in the access log, it is possible to load it\n        with a directory traversal flaw, which allows remote code execution under the\n        context of 'apache'. Please note that it may take up to several minutes to\n        retrieve access_log, which is about the amount of time required to see a shell\n        back.","rank":600,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-0297/","OSVDB (82023)","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18932","http://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=2012&suid=20120517_00"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ce7c9ac-4246-527e-a34a-0cad8551b29c"}}}
