These products are also sold under\n        the Netis brand name outside of China. This backdoor allows\n        cyber criminals to easily run arbitrary code on these routers,\n        rendering it vulnerable as a security device.\n        Some models include a non-standard echo command which doesn't\n        honor -e, and are therefore not currently exploitable with\n        Metasploit.
