The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy,\n        it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis\n        operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument\n        without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233).\n\n          The JIT region is then replaced with shellcode which loads the second stage.\n        The second stage exploits a logic error in libxpc, which uses command execution\n        via the launchd's \"spawn_via_launchd\" API (CVE-2018-4404).","rank":0,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/exploit/osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/exploit/osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/exploit/osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-4233/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-4404/","https://github.com/saelo/cve-2018-4233","https://github.com/saelo/pwn2own2018","https://saelo.github.io/presentations/blackhat_us_18_attacking_client_side_jit_compilers.pdf"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"85d5101e-a3da-5084-863b-78465c38d97e"}}}
