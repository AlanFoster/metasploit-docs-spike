This vulnerability occurs when storing multiple values\n        in a hash table and all values have the same hash value. This can cause a web server\n        parsing the POST parameters issued with a request into a hash table to consume\n        hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.\n\n        Currently, only the hash functions for PHP and Java are implemented.\n        This module was tested with PHP + httpd, Tomcat, Glassfish and Geronimo.\n        It also generates a random payload to bypass some IDS signatures.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollision_dos","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollision_dos","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollision_dos"},"references":["http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html","http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf","http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html","http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-5034/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-5035/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-4885/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-4858/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"cfb5b84e-0870-5202-bee2-2fc1dbcf44f4"}}}
