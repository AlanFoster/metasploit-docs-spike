By keeping these connections open and initiating\n    large numbers of these sessions, the memory does not get freed, and the server\n    grinds to a halt. This vulnerability was originally disclosed by Sean Dillon\n    and Zach Harding.\n\n    DISCALIMER: This module opens a lot of simultaneous connections. Please check\n    your system's ULIMIT to make sure it can handle it.
