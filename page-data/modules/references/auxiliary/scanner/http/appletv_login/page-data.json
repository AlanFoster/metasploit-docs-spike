The device has two different access control\n        modes: OnScreen and Password. The difference between the two is the\n        password in OnScreen mode is numeric-only and four digits long, which\n        means when this option is enabled, this option, the module will make\n        sure to cover all of them - from 0000 to 9999.  The Password mode is\n        more complex, therefore the usual online bruteforce strategies apply.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login"},"references":["http://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5a4717f0-4cc0-545f-9d92-75de2d447f8d"}}}
