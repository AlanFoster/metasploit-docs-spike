This\n        method is faster and simpler than traditional form-based logins.\n\n        In most cases, all you need to set is RHOSTS and some combination of\n        user/pass files; the autodiscovery should find the location of the NTLM\n        authentication point as well as the AD domain, and use them accordingly.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_ews_login","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_ews_login","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_ews_login"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ba54b38d-b35a-5699-92ae-5d7aaae2125e"}}}
