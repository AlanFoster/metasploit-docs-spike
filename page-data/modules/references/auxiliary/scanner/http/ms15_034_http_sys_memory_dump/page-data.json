Note that if the target\n        is running in VMware Workstation, this module has a high likelihood\n        of resulting in BSOD; however, VMware ESX and non-virtualized hosts\n        seem stable. Using a larger target file should result in more memory\n        being dumped, and SSL seems to produce more data as well.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/http/ms15_034_http_sys_memory_dump","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/http/ms15_034_http_sys_memory_dump","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/http/ms15_034_http_sys_memory_dump"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-1635/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2015/MS15-034","http://pastebin.com/ypURDPc4","https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/5150","https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2015/04/20/ms15-034-analyze-and-remote-detection","http://www.securitysift.com/an-analysis-of-ms15-034/","http://securitysift.com/an-analysis-of-ms15-034/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90cf1c5d-17e6-5d45-8dfb-da049c565d1b"}}}
