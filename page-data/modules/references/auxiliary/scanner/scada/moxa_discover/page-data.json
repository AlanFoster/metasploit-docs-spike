The service is known to be used on Moxa devices\n          in the NPort, OnCell, and MGate product lines.\n\n          A discovery packet compels a Moxa device to respond to the sender\n          with some basic device information that is needed for more advanced\n          functions.  The discovery data is 8 bytes in length and is the most\n          basic example of the Moxa protocol.  It may be sent out as a\n          broadcast (destination 255.255.255.255) or to an individual device.\n\n          Devices that respond to this query may be vulnerable to serious\n          information disclosure vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2016-9361.\n\n          The module is the work of Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos and is\n          derived from original work by K. Reid Wightman. Tested and validated\n          on a Moxa NPort 6250 with firmware versions 1.13 and 1.15.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/scanner/scada/moxa_discover","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/scanner/scada/moxa_discover","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/scanner/scada/moxa_discover"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-9361/","https://www.digitalbond.com/blog/2016/10/25/serial-killers/","http://www.moxa.com/support/faq/faq_detail.aspx?id=646"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d796abf2-b212-598d-834e-ca8f89b16699"}}}
