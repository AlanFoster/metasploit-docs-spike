If the \"PRINT\" option is\n        set, file contents will be printed to the screen, with any unprintable\n        characters replaced by a period.\n\n        Please see related module exploit/linux/http/pulse_secure_cmd_exec for\n        a post-auth exploit that can leverage the results from this module.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/pulse_secure_file_disclosure","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/pulse_secure_file_disclosure","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/gather/pulse_secure_file_disclosure"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-11510/","https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44101/","https://blog.orange.tw/2019/09/attacking-ssl-vpn-part-3-golden-pulse-secure-rce-chain.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/591295"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e6ef7535-3e4f-5068-9932-4cc99a325e3d"}}}
