This can be used to reduce the keyspace for the session number from 10 million\n        to 1.2 million, and with a bit of analysis it can be guessed in less than 500k tries.\n        This module does exactly that - it uses a computed occurence table to try the most common\n        combinations up to 1.2 million to try to guess a valid user session.\n        This session number can then be used to achieve code execution or download files - see\n        the other Nuuo CMS auxiliary and exploit modules.\n        Note that for this to work a user has to be logged into the system.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/nuuo_cms_bruteforce","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/nuuo_cms_bruteforce","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/gather/nuuo_cms_bruteforce"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-17888/","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-284-02","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jan/51","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/nuuo-cms-ownage.txt"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31c24d50-b3af-5623-be71-05057d7d3897"}}}
