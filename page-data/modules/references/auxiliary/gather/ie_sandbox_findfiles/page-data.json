When used in\n        combination with HTML5 sandbox iframes it is possible to use this behavior to\n        find out if a local file exists. This technique only works on Internet Explorer\n        10 & 11 since these support the HTML5 sandbox. Also it is not possible to do\n        this from a regular website as file:// URLs are blocked all together. The attack\n        must be performed locally (works with Internet zone Mark of the Web) or from a\n        share.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/ie_sandbox_findfiles","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/ie_sandbox_findfiles","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/gather/ie_sandbox_findfiles"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-3321/","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2016/MS16-095","https://securify.nl/advisory/SFY20160301/internet_explorer_iframe_sandbox_local_file_name_disclosure_vulnerability.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e19029b1-3eaf-5d39-ac9a-6675cb32fc4c"}}}
