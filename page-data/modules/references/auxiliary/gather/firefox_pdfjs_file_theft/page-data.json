The vulnerability\n        occurs in the PDF.js component, which uses Javascript to render a PDF inside a frame with\n        privileges to read local files. The in-the-wild malicious payloads searched for sensitive\n        files on Windows, Linux, and OSX. Android versions are reported to be unaffected, as they\n        do not use the Mozilla PDF viewer.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/gather/firefox_pdfjs_file_theft","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/gather/firefox_pdfjs_file_theft","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/gather/firefox_pdfjs_file_theft"},"references":["https://paste.debian.net/290146","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10021376","https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-4495/"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e41c36f4-1862-55e9-90db-9609695f42b1"}}}
