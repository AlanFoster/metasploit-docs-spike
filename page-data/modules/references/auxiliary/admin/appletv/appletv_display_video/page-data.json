Note that\n        AppleTV can be somewhat picky about the server that hosts the video.\n        Tested servers include default IIS, default Apache, and Ruby's WEBrick.\n        For WEBrick, the default MIME list may need to be updated, depending on\n        what media file is to be played. Python SimpleHTTPServer is not\n        recommended. Also, if you're playing a video, the URL must be an IP\n        address. Some AppleTV devices are actually password-protected; in that\n        case please set the PASSWORD datastore option. For password\n        brute forcing, please see the module auxiliary/scanner/http/appletv_login.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/appletv/appletv_display_video","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/appletv/appletv_display_video","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/appletv/appletv_display_video"},"references":["http://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"018dc46c-c74e-5ba6-96b2-1a99ef185b77"}}}
