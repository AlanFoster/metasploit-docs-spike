The EditDocument servlet provides file operations, such as copy and\n        delete, which are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of this,\n        any authenticated frontend user can read and delete arbitrary files from the system\n        with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role)\n        in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the\n        Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/mutiny_frontend_read_delete","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/mutiny_frontend_read_delete","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/mutiny_frontend_read_delete"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0136/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/701572","https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/05/15/new-1day-exploits-mutiny-vulnerabilities"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"dbfb628f-f55d-52c5-8097-0c9697279d99"}}}
