First, an\n        information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2015-2997) is used to obtain the file\n        system path, and then we abuse a directory traversal (CVE-2015-2996) to download\n        the file. Note that there are some limitations on Windows, in that the information\n        disclosure vulnerability doesn't work on a Windows platform, and we can only\n        traverse the current drive (if you enter C:\\afile.txt and the server is running\n        on D:\\ the file will not be downloaded).\n\n        This module has been tested with SysAid 14.4 on Windows and Linux.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/sysaid_file_download","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/sysaid_file_download","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/sysaid_file_download"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-2996/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-2997/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jun/8","https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/sysaid-14.4-multiple-vulns.txt"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"09b33846-37c1-549c-ae95-e6089136cefe"}}}
