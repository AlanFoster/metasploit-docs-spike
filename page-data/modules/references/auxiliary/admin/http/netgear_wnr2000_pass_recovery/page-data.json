It should also work with the hardware revisions v4 and v3, but this\n        has not been tested.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/netgear_wnr2000_pass_recovery"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-10175/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-10176/","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/netgear-wnr2000.txt","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/72","http://kb.netgear.com/000036549/Insecure-Remote-Access-and-Command-Execution-Security-Vulnerability"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e85f056a-7a74-5630-a988-9670647c2e1e"}}}
