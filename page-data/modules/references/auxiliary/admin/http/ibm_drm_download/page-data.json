Versions 2.0.3 and 2.0.2 are confirmed to be\n          affected, and the latest 2.0.6 is most likely affected too. Version 2.0.1 is not vulnerable.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/ibm_drm_download","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/ibm_drm_download","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/ibm_drm_download"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-4427/","https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-4429/","https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/IBM/ibm_drm/ibm_drm_rce.md","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Apr/33"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"03880f49-5f14-5c20-92cf-26a918dbe82b"}}}
