By submitting XML\n          to rails, we can influence the type used for the reset_password_token\n          parameter.  This allows for resetting passwords of arbitrary accounts,\n          knowing only the associated email address.\n\n          This module defaults to the most common devise URIs and response values,\n          but these may require adjustment for implementations which customize them.\n\n          Affects Devise < v2.2.3, 2.1.3, 2.0.5 and 1.5.4 when backed by any database\n          except PostgreSQL or SQLite3. Tested with v2.2.2, 2.1.2, and 2.0.4 on Rails\n          3.2.11. Patch applied to Rails 3.2.12 and 3.1.11 should prevent exploitation\n          of this vulnerability, by quoting numeric values when comparing them with\n          non numeric values.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/admin/http/rails_devise_pass_reset","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/admin/http/rails_devise_pass_reset","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/admin/http/rails_devise_pass_reset"},"references":["https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0233/","OSVDB (89642)","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57577","http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2013/01/security-announcement-devise-v2-2-3-v2-1-3-v2-0-5-and-v1-5-3-released/","http://www.phenoelit.org/blog/archives/2013/02/05/mysql_madness_and_rails/index.html","https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/921a296a3390192a71abeec6d9a035cc6d1865c8","https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/26e13c3ca71cbc7859cc4c51e64f3981865985d8"]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86504340-2abe-5018-8667-69e2926da81a"}}}
