Responses\n        sent by this service have by default the configurable challenge string\n        (\\x11\\x22\\x33\\x44\\x55\\x66\\x77\\x88), allowing for easy cracking using\n        Cain & Abel, L0phtcrack or John the ripper (with jumbo patch).\n\n        To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this\n        module. One way to force an SMB authentication attempt is by embedding\n        a UNC path (\\\\SERVER\\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When\n        the victim views the web page or email, their system will\n        automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP\n        address of the system running this module) and attempt to\n        authenticate. Another option is using auxiliary/spoof/{nbns,llmnr} to\n        respond to queries for names the victim is already looking for.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/auxiliary/server/capture/smb","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/auxiliary/server/capture/smb","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/auxiliary/server/capture/smb"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4b9c5dbe-82c3-5ded-a82d-384e880d26ce"}}}
