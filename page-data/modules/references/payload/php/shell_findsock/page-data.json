Unfortunately, this payload\n        can leave conspicuous evil-looking entries in the\n        apache error logs, so it is probably a good idea\n        to use a bind or reverse shell unless firewalls\n        prevent them from working.  The issue this\n        payload takes advantage of (CLOEXEC flag not set\n        on sockets) appears to have been patched on the\n        Ubuntu version of Apache and may not work on\n        other Debian-based distributions.  Only tested on\n        Apache but it might work on other web servers\n        that leak file descriptors to child processes.","rank":300,"fields":{"detailsSlug":"/modules/details/payload/php/shell_findsock","documentationSlug":"/modules/documentation/payload/php/shell_findsock","referencesSlug":"/modules/references/payload/php/shell_findsock"},"references":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e8972619-f75e-5749-b1fc-510c37e8dd9d"}}}
